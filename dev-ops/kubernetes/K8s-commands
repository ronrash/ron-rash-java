kubectl: This is the command-line tool for interacting with a Kubernetes cluster.
It allows you to deploy applications, inspect and manage cluster resources, and view logs.

config: This is a subcommand of kubectl. It is used for modifying or viewing configuration details related to kubectl.
The configuration details include cluster, user, and context information.

use-context: This is a specific operation under the config subcommand.
The use-context operation is used to switch the current context to a specified one.

K8-DEV-CS01-CL01: This is the name of the context you want to switch to.
In Kubernetes, a context is essentially a combination of a cluster, a user, and a namespace.
 It represents a specific environment within your Kubernetes setup.
 For example, you might have different contexts for development, testing, and production environments.

So, when you run the command kubectl config use-context K8-DEV-CS01-CL01,
you are telling kubectl to change the current context to K8-DEV-CS01-CL01.
This means that all subsequent kubectl commands will be executed against the cluster and namespace defined in this context,
and using the credentials associated with it.
This command is very useful in scenarios where you are managing multiple clusters or
when you need to switch between different environments (like development, staging, and production) within the same cluster.
