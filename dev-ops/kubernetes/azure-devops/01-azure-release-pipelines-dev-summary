create pipeline and release pipleine so that we can deploy our services or applications to different cluster or different namespaces
like dev,qa prod
This helps us with testing our code in different envs

1. we will create k8s cluster for dev qa and prod
we can do that within a single cluster also bt with different namespaces

create names spaces in a kubernetes cluster
create a pipeline
create release pipeline to deploy changes to dev or qa or


after all of this delete ur kubernetes clusters
# Before Clean-Up: List all Pods and Services
kubectl get pod,svc --all-namespaces

# Clean-Up all Apps in Kubernetes
kubectl delete ns dev
kubectl delete ns qa
kubectl delete ns staging
kubectl delete ns prod

# After Clean-Up: List all Pods and Services
kubectl get pod,svc --all-namespaces
