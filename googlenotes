How I Cracked the Google India and Amazon Web Services (AWS) Vancouver, Canada Interview.

1. Setting a target for 2-3 months of Preparation.
It includes refreshing on dsa and system design and preparing a bit on the behavioural aspects.
Allocating time in the evenings and weekends for preparation and spare time to refresh to not get burnt out.

2. Coding and Problem Solving: Studying DSA strictly following leetcode and doing only medium questions.
I solved around 100 questions in this round of preparation and leetcode premium is must for
quick detailed solutions and alternatives to what you came up with.
Practice all patterns and types of questions
* Greedy problems
* Sliding Window
* Dynamic Programing
* DFS And BFS in Graphs ( Very imp for google)
* Backtracking
* Trees
* Sorting
* Stack, Queue, Linked List
* Bit Manipulation

3. System Design: As we all know there is no one correct answer and after taking almost
100 system design interviews I figured you need to go principles first in these interviews and
never try to cram answers from the resources out there. Also all questions asked were new and were not there on the internet.
* Funtional Requirements
* Non Funtional Requirements
* Back of the envelope calculations
* Sql and NoSql databases and understanding popular databases like Mysql, Mongodb and Cassandra.
* Kafka, RabbitMq type systems their differences and use cases.
* Load Balancing, Api Gateway, Service Discovery,CI/CD, Kubernetes etc
* Strong skills for Database Schema both for sql and Nosql
* Deploying and Scaling Web Services
* Writing APIs and security of APIs
* Understand sharding, gossip, consensus algorithms.

4. Behavioural Aspect:
Study for the Googlyness and Amazon Leadership principles.
You need to have solid examples to back up your answers.
 Questions will always be like “Tell me a time you did this”.

Some surprises which I did not prepare for :

1. Strong understanding of Concurrency and problems associated with it.
2. Strong understanding of the language you are coding in, for me it was Java.
3. Great testing and code review skills, was tested in google.
