remove git init rm -rf .git
git log --graph --branch --oneline

This is fast forward where we will not see a commit for merging feature to master
 master --> c1 c2 -->cut a feature branch --> c1, c2 , f1, f2
now master does not have any commits ,, simply merge the changes into master either by -->git merge feature
this will create 2 commit on top of master like c1,c2 f1,f2
or squash with one commit --> git merge --squash feature --> we will have to commit this seprataley

Recursive
but when we merge feature like this ---> git merge  --no-ff feature --> this will create an extra commit showing our merge to master
c1,c2,f1,f2 and an extra megre commit like "Megre branch 'feature ' into master"

Now if we have master  ---> m1 m2          m3
                                feature - m1 m2 f1 f2
now if we merge feature to master ,, which also has moved on it will do a recursive merge
git merge --squash feature --> m1 m2 , m3 , "merge feature into master"
git merge feature --> m1,m2,f1,f2,m3, "merge feature into master"

git merge master team/CCT-1545 --no-ff  -- this will create a merge commit
So, the above command means that you want to merge the changes from the master branch into the team/mcc branch
and create a merge commit, even if a fast-forward merge would be possible.
This approach helps maintain a clear separation of feature development (in the team/mcc branch)
and the main branch (in this case, master), making it easier to track when specific features were integrated into the main branch.

REBASE--

 so
git pull --rebase origin team/CCT-1545 -- this will rebase from the same branch
git pull --rebase master team/CCT-154 -- rebase change from aster to our branch -- rebase will
git pull  --> combines two actions - git fetch and git merge or git rebase.
It's used to update your current branch with the latest changes from a remote repository.
create new commit hashes  but not an extra

git pull --rebase origin team/SCMI resolve conflicts if there are any

git add .
git commit --amend --no-edit
git rebase --continue

if there is an error like tip of ur branch
git push origin --force

rebase to master
git switch master
git rebase feature master
git push origin --force

git rebase

master -- m1 m2 --->m3{new commit is m3} feature branch is cut from m2
feature   m1 m2 --->f1 f2

after git rebase m3 will be added to the feature branch with new commit ids
master -- m1 m2 m3
feature   m1 m2 m3 f1 f2 -- these f1 and f2 and m3 commit ids will change

after git merge --> f1 and f2 commits will be added with ids but this will not creata an extra commit kind of fast forward
master -- m1 m2 m3 f1 f2
feature   m1 m2 m3 f1 f2

points to remember git rebase will avoid additional merge commits but create new commit ids or hashes for the same commits
these commit m3 f1 f2 are will have different hash on different branches.


when to apply git rebase
1.when we have new commits in the master and we need those changes to work with our feature branch
ie, fetaure relies on changes from master
2.Rebase master into feature branch, this will affect the ids in ur feature branch
3. feature is finished - u need fast forward ie no additional commit in master

Rebase re-writes code history.

Git Cherry PIck
master m1 m2 m3
feature m1 m2 f1 f2 f3 -->

now if we want a specfic commit from feature -- copy the commit id -- switch to master/whichever branch u want
git switch master
git cherry-pic f2<commitid> master m1 m2 m3 f2 {but this f2 will have a diff commit id }
