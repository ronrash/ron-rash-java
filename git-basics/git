#create a branch in pipeline
then push
git push -u origin dev/CCT-1912

git checkout existing-branch
git checkout -b feature-branch
git push -u origin feature-branch
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/current-branch


git pull --rebase origin team/SCMI
git commit -m "SCMI-1303"
git commit --amend --no-edit
git reset commitid

git branch --> to show which branch we are in
git branch -r --> to check for all remote branches
gt branch -a  --> to show all branches
git branch feature-a --> create new branch
git checkout feature-a --> switch to different branch
git switch main --> swithced to this branch
git checkout -b feature-new --> create and checkout to the new branch
git branch -d feature-a --> -d to delete a branch

# to restore changes in a file
git restore . --> in the curent pat
git restore filename --> restore changes in that file

git clean -df --> clear all untracked files

to go back to a commit
git log
git checkout <commitid>

Head ??
Head is the latest commit in any  branch
do a git log it will show the latest head -> main origin/main

Detached Head ?
when we checkout a commit and the git is unaware of the commit belongs to which branch,
becoz the same commit can belong to 2 same commits on 2 diff branches
then it is called a detached head

how to handle git detached head ??
git log --> we see c1 c2 c3 commits --> we got to c2 commit --> git checkout c2 --> now we are in detached head on c2 commit??
do git log (HEAD)
git branch --> u will see --> * (HEAD detached at 7453972)
we make our changes in c2 commit detached state  {git add . , git commit -am " detached head commits "}
then we create a new detached branch-->  git branch detached-branch ,, and the switch to orginal branch  here it is main and then merge that detached branch

steps to handle detached head
git checkout <commit-id>  --> checkout to a new commit
git log --> see deatched head
git branch  --> see detached branch
make chanegs and commit in detached state
git add .
git commit -m " detahced commit changes"
create a new branch detached-head-branch --> create a new branch ths will put all changes to this branch
git switch main --> checkout to main branch
git merge detached-head-branch --> merge this branch to main to get all the changes

# git reflog -- reflog alllows us to get back lost information
Reset A commit
git checkout <commit-id>
git restore --staged filename
git log -- check logs
git reset <commitid>

#similarly we can perform the same steps to when we delete a branch
git checkout -b feature-delete -- this is the branch we will delete and then using reflog retain the changes
add/commit  some file here---> git commit -am "some changes in feature-delet" and then switch to main and delete that branch

switch to master --> git switch master ,, delete the branch git branch -D feature-delete
do a git reflog --> git reflog --> u can see ur commit from the delete branch
{from here perform the same steps we did in detachec } ie checkout that commit, commit the changes, then create a branch and then merge those changes in master
git checkout commitid
git add . , git commit -m " the lost changes"
git branch feature-delete
git switch feature-delete ,, add some more changes
git swicth main ,, git  merge feature-delete



checkout a specific commit
git checkout coomit-id --> this may lead to a detached head
to get out of this just checkout to a branhc
git checkout branc-name

undo changes from a file
 git restore .

# stash
git stash
git stash apply

git stash list  -- shows a list of stashed changes
git stash apply 1

add messages to ur stashes
git stash push -m "latest changes"
git stash list
git stash pop 0  --> apply and remove the stashed changes
git stash clear --> clears the entire stash



#rebase --
when your master is ahead from your feature branch the rebase will pull changes from
master and apply beneath your local changes in the feature branch

git pull -r origin main  -- this will pull changes from master
# resolve conflicts
git add .
git rebase --continue and then give a commit message
git push -f  --> forcefully



fork a repository
upstrem -- from where you hae forked a repository
git remote add upstream https://.................

create a new branch

git merge team/cct-857 team/cct-876 --no-ff


remove files from the staging area
git rm --cached -r .
git rm --cached -r fileName
git remote add origin https://github.com/rohitprashar/crnew.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
