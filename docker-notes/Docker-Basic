Files and Folders that containers use from host operating system

The host's file system: Docker containers can access the host file system using bind mounts,
which allow the container to read and write files in the host file system.

Networking stack: The host's networking stack is used to provide network connectivity to the container.
Docker containers can be connected to the host's network directly or through a virtual network.

System calls: The host's kernel handles system calls from the container,
which is how the container accesses the host's resources, such as CPU, memory, and I/O.

Namespaces: Docker containers use Linux namespaces to create isolated environments for the container's processes.
Namespaces provide isolation for resources such as the file system, process ID, and network.

Control groups (cgroups): Docker containers use cgroups to limit and control the amount of resources, such as CPU, memory, and I/O, that a container can access.

It's important to note that while a container uses resources from the host operating system,
it is still isolated from the host and other containers, so changes to the container do not affect the host or other containers.
