# Advantages of Multistage the images are lightwieght uses caching, ur docker image size will be like 15 -20 mb
# Distroless images are lightwieght and secure ,, it has the bare min to run ur application
# why they are secure becoz it does not even have base packages like find ls wget curl which is less vulnerable to threats or attacks
# and suppose we use go land we dont even need the a runtime bexoz these languages are staticall typed
