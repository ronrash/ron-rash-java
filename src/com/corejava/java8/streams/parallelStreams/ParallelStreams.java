    // streams run sequentially but with parralel streams we divide the code to multiple streams
    // and are executed on separate cores  and the final result is combination of thse streams
    // order of execution is not under are control

    // paralell streams use Fork/Join framework
    // number of threads created === number of processors in the machine
