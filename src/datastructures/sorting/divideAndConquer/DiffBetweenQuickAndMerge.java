    /*
    *  Merge Sort is a stable sorting algorithm, which means that it maintains the relative order of equal elements in the sorted array.
    * Quick Sort, on the other hand, is not a stable algorithm and may change the order of equal elements.

Quick Sort is an in-place sorting algorithm, which means that it does not require any extra space to sort the array.
* Merge Sort, however, requires extra space to merge the sorted subarrays.

In the worst-case scenario, Quick Sort has a time complexity of O(n^2), which occurs when the pivot element is the smallest or largest element in the array,
* and the partitioning routine does not evenly divide the array.
* Merge Sort, on the other hand, always has a time complexity of O(n log n), regardless of the input.

Quick Sort is generally faster than Merge Sort for small arrays or arrays with a high degree of disorder.
* Merge Sort is better suited for larger arrays or arrays with a low degree of disorder.
