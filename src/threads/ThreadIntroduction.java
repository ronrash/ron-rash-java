    // A process is a program executioon like msword ,aint browising
    // thread is als a process or a unit of execution within a process and they share memory and that is why we have to deal
    // with concurrent programming


    // In a microservices world we have to deal with blocaking calls -- apply asynchronous process ie. completeableFUture


    // CONCURRENCY VS PARALLELISM -- ONE CPU MULTI THREADING IS DIFFICULT
    // lifecycle of threads

    // new state -- every thread is in new state until the start method
    // active state -- 2 substates -- runnable --afte the start method is called ,, running when cpu is aasigned
    // blcked/waiting state -- when the thread is waiting for

    // the threads of the same process run in a shared memory space
