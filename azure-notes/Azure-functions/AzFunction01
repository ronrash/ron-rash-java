Azure Servless Services
Compute -> Azure FUnction Apps {event drive compute services}
Run code on demand -- Unlike IAAS or PAAS
No managing of software and hardware -- the cloud manages it
Pay when ur code runs
trigger ur code it runs and the task is over![](../../Screenshot 2023-08-07 at 13.34.13.png)

Triggers and Bindings
triggers what triggers the function apps
in an event driven system it could be the events in the eventgrid
There are 4 types of trigger
HTTP trigger
Timer Trigger
Blob Storage
Queue triggers

A Function app must have one trigger- trigger is basically what invokes that trigger

Bindings --> declarative way to connect services and resources to the azure functions

<------Creation of function Apps -- >>>>>>
we can create a group of function Apps for particlaur resources
they are under resource groups and they have storage accounts which stores the function app files
Os - in whihc the function app runs
Plan Type - Consumption - pay as you go , sacles automatically
App Service plan is where you have dedicated reserved VMs, which are always running and you manage
the scaling by increasing and decreasing the number of VMs
Premium plan, where there is at least one function app instance running to avoid a cold start,which
means u have to pay even the function app is not running

Monitoring of function Apps
Application Insights

Creating a Function within the function Apps
Http Trigger - Name
3 Authorization type
 Function - a function or host key is required - fuction key works only for that function ,
 host key works for all the functions within that function aspp
 Admin - Level Authorization a special master key is required

 and admin they require some sort of key based aithorizations


Edit Trigger --> Integration -- request input for our trigger
Authorization level --> Http methods allowed like get post

Input and Output bindings which is used to integrate our function app with other azure services

Function.json file contains all  the triggers and binding of our function in a json format

The function has 2 params context and req
The context object is used to pass data to and from ur application

The function keys
Function keys
Function keys are scoped to this function and can be used to access this function.
Function --> app keys
System keys
System keys are automatically managed by the Function runtime.
System Keys provide granular access to functions runtime features.
Host keys (all functions)
Use Host keys with your clients to access all your HTTP functions in the app.
_master key grants admin access to Functions Runtime APIs.

These authntication and aithorization is used to protect function apps during development
 and for protection in production we can use alternative like Api Management.

Monitor -- tab is used for monitoring logs , how when what happened to function apps
Configuration - This configuration page is used to store function app configuration settings like connection strings
               and even the global variables that are used inside the Azure function code.
how Azure manages your code and the runtime. u can get that info by accessing the storage account in overview
Azure function runtime creates a couple of blob containers to store logs and secrets associated to your functions.
