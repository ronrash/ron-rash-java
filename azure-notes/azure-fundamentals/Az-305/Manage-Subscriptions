4 key roles setup by Azure
Contributor --> can make changes to azure resources but cannot assign roles to other resources
owner --> the can manage resources and allow the user{owner} to assign roles to other users
reader -- only view/read the azure resources
user access administrator -- only allowed to manage user access,but no access to resources themselves


Assign roles to users
Go to any resourcegrp or subscription
click on accesscontrol(IAM) --> add role assignment --> select the role {owner,contributor,reader,user accessa admin}--> choose the user



Demo to add or change the subscription admins
goto subscriptions --> access control--> add co admin
the user will not be shown uder role assignments becoz these are not role assignments, they are actually permissions over subscription

To remove go uder classic admin adn remove

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subsription Policies
Azure Security Center --> Creates default security policy for subscription

They are many default security policies
Security Updates - retrieves a daily list of security/criticalk updates
Security Configurations
Endpoint Protection
Disk Encryption
Network Security Groups
Web app firewall

-------- Resource Groups------
the resources in a resource grp can deployed in multiple regions
the resource goupr requres a location to store deployment metadata information and definition assoicated with group

dev/test resource groups
staging resource groups
production resource groups

Resource Policies
Azure policy is a service which create,assigns and manages policies  and enforces diff rules over azure resources.
then these resources wil stay compliant ie, follow these rules
eg -- a policy which restricts an azure vm of a certain size ,,
if u try to create an azure resource with a greater size ,, it will not allow this

Resource locks
prevent resources from being accidentaly deleted

Types of locks
Delete
Read Only

Lock Levels
CanNotDelete -- allows users to read and modify a resource but not delete
Read Only  -- allows users to only read not modify nor delete similar to read only access role

Resource locks are inherited so lock at parent level ,, is inhertied by all resources
under the same subscription,resource group

Eg Of readOnly lock -->causing confustion -- areadonly lock on storage account will prevent the users from listing the keys
becuase the listing keys is thru a post request as keys which are returned are available for write operation
Readonly lock on appservice resources prevents displaying of files becoz displayin files requires write access

to create or delete management locks u need access to
microsoft.authorization/*
or
microsoft.authorization/locks/*actions

only built in user and user access admin are granted these roles

create a locks
go to a resource or rg or subscripton .. go to settings under that locks ->create a lock
name and lock type

--------------Tags--------------------------------------------------------
custom grouping of resources  ,, keep them or group them
eg envirnoment, prod ,to a resource group
limit for a rg is 15 tags pre rg ,, name len is 512 chars
cannot contain special characters

Tags are not inherited
Use contributor role so that tags cn be applied to all the resources under that rg.
eg top apply tag to all vms use tag Virtual machine contributor role

--------------MOve resource group to another resource group--------------------------------------------------------
when moving resurces across rg ,,both source and destinations are locked , the function normally but cant be added or deleted or uodated
thy are blocked untill the process is completed

Steps to be taken
the source and destination subscription must exist within the same azure active directory teanant
the dest subscription should be registered for the resource provider if not u will get an erro
the account moving resources should have the following access/permissions

source
Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourceGroups/moveResources/action

destination
Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourceGroups/write
