AzCopy
AzCopy is a command-line utility  to copy blobs or files to or from your storage account.
With AzCopy, you can upload files, download files, copy files between storage accounts, and even synchronize files.
 AzCopy can even be configured to work with other cloud providers to help move files back and forth between clouds.

 Synchronizing blobs or files with AzCopy is one-direction synchronization

 It doesn't synchronize bi-directionally based on timestamps or other metadata.
