manage resource tags
You can add, modify, or delete resource tags through Windows PowerShell,
the Azure CLI,
Azure Resource Manager templates,
the REST API, or the Azure portal.

You can use Azure Policy to enforce tagging rules and conventions
Resources don't inherit tags from subscriptions and resource groups
allowing you to create custom tagging schema on each level based on resource resource group subscription

A resource tag consists of a name and a value. You can assign one or more tags to each Azure resource.

example of tags
Name         Value
AppName    The name of the application that the resource is part of.
CostCenter The internal cost center code
env         prod dev or test
impact how mission critical the resource is

You might decide that only mission-critical resources have the Impact tag.
