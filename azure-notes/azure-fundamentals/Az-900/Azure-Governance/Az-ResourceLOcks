How do I delete or change a locked resource?
To modify a locked resource, you must first remove the lock.
After you remove the lock, you can apply any action you have permissions to perform.
Resource locks apply regardless of RBAC permissions.
 Even if you're an owner of the resource, you must still remove the lock before you can perform the blocked activity.

 Eg
 u created a resource --> storage account and locked it and gave readonlylock
 after that u are now trying to add a container to the resource i.e storage accont
 when u add
 The error message lets you know that you couldn't create a storage container because a lock is in place.
 The read-only lock prevents any create or update operations on the storage account, so you're unable to create a storage container.

 Modify the resource lock and create a storage container

 Change the Lock type to Delete and select OK. now u can add the container but cannot delete to delete remove the lock from the resource
 select the lock and then delete it
 after this u can delete the resource {storage account}
