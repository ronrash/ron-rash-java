Azure Virtual Machines (VMs) - IAAS
Total control over the operating system (OS).
The ability to run custom software.
To use custom hosting configurations.

Virtual Machine Sets
A virtual machine needs a network card, storage and a virtual network.
It does not need a public IP address. In fact, most Azure VMs are private and are not accessible from the Internet.

Virtual machine scale sets let you create and manage a group of identical, load-balanced VMs.
with virtual machine scale sets, Azure automates most of that work
Scale sets allow you to centrally manage, configure, and update a large number of VMs in minutes
number of VM instances can automatically increase or decrease in response to demand
automatically deploy a load balancer
With virtual machine scale sets, you can build large-scale services for areas such as compute, big data, and container workloads.


Virtual machine availability sets
tool to help you build a more resilient, highly available environment
Availability Sets allow you to tell Azure which virtual machines are identical,
so that Azure will keep them apart physically inside the datacenter.
This helps when there are either expected or unexpected downtime,
by increasing the chances that one issue does not affect all VMs in a single Availability Set.
 Availability sets are designed to prevent you from losing all your VMs with a single network or power failure.
 Availability sets do this by grouping VMs in two ways: update domain and fault domain.

 Update domain:  groups VMs that can be rebooted at the same time.
                 only one update domain grouping will be offline at a time. one update grp will be given lik 30 mins before next one can start

 Fault domain :  groups  VMs by common power source and network switch. availability set will split vms across 3 fault domains.
                 This protects against a power or network failure

Examples of when to use VMs
testing,development,extending resource or disaster recovery

Size (purpose, number of processor cores, and amount of RAM)
Storage disks (hard disk drives, solid state drives, etc.)
Networking (virtual network, public IP address, and port configuration)

Azure virtual desktop is a desktop and application virtualization service that runs on the cloud
Azure Virtual Desktop provides centralized security management for users' desktops with Microsoft Entra ID.
with this data and apps are separated from the local hardware.  actual desktop and apps are running in the cloud,
