Azure ExpressRoute
connect on-premises networks into the Microsoft cloud over a private connection called as ExpressRoute Circuit.
like azure and microsoft ffice 365
allows you to connect offices, datacenters, or other facilities to the Microsoft cloud.
 Each location would have its own ExpressRoute circuit.
 ExpressRoute connections don't go over the public Internet

 Benefits
 Connectivity to Microsoft cloud services across all regions
 Dynamic routing between your network and Microsoft via Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).

 ExpressRoute enables direct access to the following services in all regions:

 Microsoft Office 365
 Microsoft Dynamics 365
 Azure compute services, such as Azure Virtual Machines
 Azure cloud services, such as Azure Cosmos DB and Azure Storage

 Global connectivity
 say you had an office in Asia and a datacenter in Europe, both with ExpressRoute circuits connecting them to the Microsoft network

 ExpressRoute connectivity models
 CloudExchange colocation - refers to your datacenter, office, or other facility being physically co-located at a cloud exchange,like ISP
  you can request a virtual cross-connect to the Microsoft cloud
 Point-to-point Ethernet connection - using a point-to-point connection to connect your facility to the Microsoft
 Any-to-any connection -  you can integrate your wide area network (WAN) with Azure eg between your datacenter and any branch offices.
 Directly from ExpressRoute sites -ExpressRoute Direct provides dual 100 Gbps or 10-Gbps connectivity,
 which supports Active/Active connectivity at scale.

 Co-location refers to your datacenter, office, or other facility being physically co-located at a cloud exchange,like ISP

With ExpressRoute, your data doesn't travel over the public internet,
so it's not exposed to the potential risks associated with internet communications.
 ExpressRoute is a private connection from your on-premises infrastructure to your Azure infrastructure.
 Even if you have an ExpressRoute connection, DNS queries, certificate revocation list checking,
 and Azure Content Delivery Network requests are still sent over the public internet.
