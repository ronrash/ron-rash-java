Azure Blob storage allows you to store unstructured data in Microsoft's Azure cloud.
Blobs can be any sort of data.
 Containers are used to organize blobs within a Storage Account.
 You can store up to 500TB of data in a single container.

 In this Lab Step, you will use the general-purpose Storage Account
 General-purpose storage accounts don't support hot or cool storage, which requires a Blob storage account
 Block blobs are the most general type of blob
 block blob is made up of individual blocks that can be up to 100MB in size.
 A block blob can include up to 50,000 blocks, giving a maximum blob size of 4.75TB

 n this Lab, you will use blobs small enough to fit within a single block.

 1.Create a container called images by entering:
 New-AzStorageContainer -Name images -Permission Off

     The Permissions parameter specifies what type of anonymous read access is allowed. It can be set to:

 Container: Anonymous access to list the container contents and read blobs
 Blob: Anonymous access to read blobs
 Off: No anonymous access

 PublicAccess is Off.

 2. Upload a sample image to the images container:

 When dealing with the contents of a blob, the cmdlets end with Content.
 This command succeeds because you are logged in as the storage account creator,
 so this is not an anonymous request.
 By default, the BlobType parameter is BlockBlob. That is why the output shows BlobType: BlockBlob.

 3. Get the blob you just uploaded from the container:
 $blob = Get-AzStorageBlob -Container images -Blob image.png
 it does not download the content of the blob

 4. Print the $blob properties:
    $blob

 5. Get the URI of the blob:
    $blob.ICloudBlob.StorageUri
