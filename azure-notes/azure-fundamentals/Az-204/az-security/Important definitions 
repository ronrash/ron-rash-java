what is service principal
  service principal is basically a managed identity ie,
  It acts as a "service account" that applications can use to authenticate and interact with Azure resources without requiring user credentials.
  Suppose you have an application deployed on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) that needs to access an Azure SQL Database.
  u create a service principal object with the appropriate permissions to access the database.
  application uses this service principal to authenticate and securely access the database without needing user credentials.

  Service principal
  Service Principal: MyServicePrincipal
  -------------------------------------------
  | Client ID (appId):     7c9e6679-7425-40de-944b-e07fc1f90ae7
  | Tenant ID:             12345678-90ab-cdef-1234-567890abcdef
  | Object ID:             2a7a8e8b-934d-4b1d-9080-14cc2f4bb4d6
  | Authentication Method: Client Secret or Certificate
  | Assigned Roles:        Contributor
  -------------------------------------------
This gives you the key identifiers and attributes used to manage and authenticate the service principal.

Summary:
A service principal consists of a Client ID, Tenant ID,Object ID, and an authentication method (either a Client Secret or Certificate).
It is assigned roles to define what resources it can access.
It’s mainly a collection of identifiers and credentials that allow applications to authenticate securely without user intervention.

tenanat Id - The Azure AD tenant itself (organization’s directory)
             it applies to all the objects within a particalar organization
             it has a global scope
             used when an app identifies itself within a tenant
             az login --tenant 12345678-90ab-cdef-1234-567890abcdef
             (Logging in to Azure with a specific Tenant ID)

object id -- group or user or app within the tenant
          Used to identify and manage a specific object, such as assigning permissions to a service principal or user
          You want to assign the Contributor role to a service principal.
          az role assignment create --assignee-object-id 2a7a8e8b-934d-4b1d-9080-14cc2f4bb4d6 --role Contributor
          (Assigning a role to an object using its Object ID)

client id -- specific to an appllication
When you configure an app for Azure AD authentication, you specify the Client ID so that Azure AD knows which application is trying to authenticate.

Service princiapl is a combination of these
You create a Service Principal for a CI/CD pipeline to deploy resources in Azure.
It uses the Client ID and Client Secret to authenticate and perform tasks automatically.
A Service Principal is configured through its Client ID and managed using its Object ID for various tasks like access control and permission
