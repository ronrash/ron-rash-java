There are several logging and monitoring connections to Azure Functions.
In this Lab Step, you will explore the logging and monitoring built into the Azure Function Console and Application Insights.
The Azure Function Console is useful for developing Functions in the Azure Portal, like you have done in this Lab,
and for focusing in on a single Function.
Application Insights has a much broader scope and provides more details about the Function and its operating environment.
You can also correlate events in Application Insights because it can consume logs and metric data from other services.
Application Insights can be configured after a Function is deployed,
however you included Application Insights when you first created your Function so it is ready to use.
