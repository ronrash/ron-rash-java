there are 5 storage services in azure
Azure blob storage -- text files video , unstrictired data
Azure files -- azure smb
Queues -- messages upt millions of messages an 64kb
Tables -- nosql data
azure disks -- for storing data for vms

They can be accessed by storage accounts

 Azure Blobs
 Account--> container --> blob {text,images ,videos ,files }
 containers are like directoris to store/organize the blobs

 3 types of blob
 Block blob -->  contains about 190.7tib of data, contains block of data that can be managed individually
 Page Blob -->  store random access files upto 8tib of data
 Append BLob --> used to append data, good for logging data from virtual machines


========================================================================================================================================================
Azure files
Makes file sharing available in the cloud
Use industry standard SMB Server Message Block Protocol
You can mount files from windows,linux/mac or onprem
You can use Azure file Sync service with Azure Files to cache ur azure files on windows server {speed data }
Azure files can now completely replace traditional on prem file servers and also Azure Files Ad authentication allows access control
Helpful when lift and shift applications from onprem to cloud for apps that use azure files share to store app data

Management thre Azure cli,powershell,portal  azure storage explorer ,, fuly managed by microsft

Createing an azure file share
Create a storage account
got to storage account say name is rohits-storage-account --> from overview go to templates file shares --> create file share {give name}


==========================================================================================================================
Azure Queues
Store large number of messages
Used in distributed apps

Components
Url Format -- Storage Account -- Queue -- Messages
                       <storage-account>                       <queue>
Url Format --> https://mystorageaccount.queue.core.windows.net/images-to-process

Create a queue
got to storage account say name is rohits-storage-account --> from overview go to templates queue  --> create queues  {give name}

==========================================================================================================================
Azure Tables
Allows u to store nosql data
Key/value

It is perfect for structured data as well

url is https://mystorageaccount.table.core.windows.net/<table>
A table is collection of entities
doesnt enforce a relationship between the entities
A single entity can store all kinds of data

Entity os similar to a table row --> 1mb of data, has properties , 252 properties for each entity

Account --table --entity {name,email,}{name,email,id-proof}{name,college}

There is a premimu table experience in Cosmos db

==========================================================================================================================
Azure Managed Disks
Similar to a physical disk on prem servers but its virtualized
Its a block level storage volume    uses in azure vm and managed by azure
99.999    5 9s availability
50k VM disks of a specific type is allowed in a region in each subscription

Create a Managed Disk
Specify the size
Specify the type

Types of Disk
Ultra Disks
Standard HDD
Standard SSD
Premium SSD

2 types of encryption
SSE - Server Side , performed by azure storage service and is enabled by default for all managed disks,provides encryption at rest and also snapsjots
ADE - Azure Disk -- enable on os and data disks for vm, on windows vms ,, disks are encrypted using Bit locker technology,on LInux Vms DM-encrypt tech

3 Disk Roles in Azure
DATA DISK - attached to vms called managed disks, store app data,registered as SCSI drive, max capacity of 32 TB
OS DISK - when u deploy a vm ,its deployed with a single OS Disk Attached, hosts vm os and boot volume, max capacity is 4 tb
TEMP DISK - every vm has a temp disk , not a managed disk ,not for storage, only for hosting(page file and swap files),
              data maybe lost during vm redeployment and
             linux temp disks are /dev/sdb
