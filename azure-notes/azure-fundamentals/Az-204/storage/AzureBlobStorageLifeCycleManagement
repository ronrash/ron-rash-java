Hot Tier -- > highest storage cost, lowest access cost, frequently accessed
Cool Tier --> Infrequent, Storages cost is low , acccess cost is high,, upto 30 days ,, penalty fpr deleting data before that
Archive Tier --> rarely accessed , storag low ,acces hight , penalty of accessed before 180 days,,
it takes upt 0 15 hours before u can access data


Lifecycle Policy -->
move data from hot tier to cool tier after 30 days
move data from cool to archive after 12 months
delet data from archive after 10 years

Creating a policy
storage account --> lifecycle managemnet {only for gen purpose v2 and blob storage accounts}==>
add a rule --rulname --> aply rule --> blob type and blob subtype {blob base}
here create rules and create conditions
if base blob was created more than 30 days move to cool storage
if base blob was created more than  365ays move to archive storage
if base blob was created more than 365*10 days delete blob

Azure policy runs once in 24 hrs

we can use filters to apply these rules/policies to a certain type of blobs
select option -->limit blob with filters

2 types of filters
Blob Prefix
Blob Index
You can set rules/policies for many storage accounts or blobs use a configuration file or json

click on the code view
rule tab 2 sections
Rule Actions
Rule Filters

donwload this policy file and make necessay changes and then upload this file and use the below caommnd to apply it
command to make change from command line is
az storage account management-policy create --account-name ronstorageaccount --policy policy.json --resource-group ron-rg


Blob versoning ,, if turned on it will save a copy of the blob everytime blob is modified ,, in that way u can go to a previous version of blob

Bobl Subtypes
Blob base

Questions
a potential conditions for action in a lifecycle rule
Days since blob was created,modified or accessed

An Azure Storage lifecycle policy rule contains which two parts
rule actions and filters
For example, suppose we want a lifecycle rule to only apply to blobs that start with the word “report”,
then we’d select “Limit blobs with filters”.
 Now there’s a tab called “Filter set”.
 There are two types of filters we can apply: blob prefix and blob index match.
 The second one is more complicated and requires tagging your blobs before it’ll work.
 The blob prefix is the one we need for our example.
  We just need to type “report” in this field. And we have to click the Update button.
  Now the rule will apply to any blobs that start with those letters.
