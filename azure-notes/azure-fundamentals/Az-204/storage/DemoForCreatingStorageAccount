goto stroage accounts
subscription+rg--> location,
name --should be unique ,, lowercase eg ronstorageaccount
performance {standard or premium}
account kind --> blob, general purpose v1 or v2
accesstier --hot or cool {archive can be set at blob level and not storage level}
replication {lrs,zrs,ra-grs,gzrs,ra-gzrs}

In networking we can allow
public endpoint --> access this storage account from anywhere
public endpoint{selected networks}--> only from selected networks
private endpoint --> slect priavte network {this will assign a private ip address from the virtual network that we select and assign it to the storage account}
all traffic between the storage account and vnet will be secured by a private link


------------------Blob Storage------------
oject storage solution
access thru rest api ,sdks ,pwershell,clis

url for blob storage is account name

account --> containers--> blob
conatiners are used to organize the blobs like directories in a file

3types of bob
Block Blob --> 190.t tib of data, managed individually
Append Blob --> append operations , logging data for vms
Page Blob --> stores random access data upto 8tib , stores vhd files which serve as disks for vms

we have storage account name --> ronstorageaccount
now lets create a container for blobs
+ container {lowecase} roncontainer

---------Azure Files-----
makes file shares availbale in cloud
standard is smb server message block protocol

Azure file sync with azure files can be used to cache ur azure files on windows servers for users closely located
speed access data
Azure files can now completely replace onprem file servers
Azure files Ad Authentication means allowing on prem file to be shared
also hepful in lift and shift datat
fully managed services

create an azure file
we have storage account name --> ronstorageaccount
goto file share --> ronfileshare21 --> quota upto 5129gib
default is 5tb
click on the file share resource ,, use options like connect , upload create dir structure

---------Azure Queues-----
Normally used to store messages
queue service is made up of many components
url format ,storage account queue messages{64 kb }
https://ronstorageaccount.queue.core.windows.net/images-to-process

create a queue
we have storage account name --> ronstorageaccount
goto queues share --> ronqueue --> add a message

---------Azure Table Storage-----
Allows u to store structured  no sql data in cloud

storage --> tables --> entities {name ,email {}

---------Azure Disks -----
associated with vms ,, like actaul physical disks ,, but these are virtual

types of disk
ultra disks
premium ssd
standard ssd
standard hdd

99.99999% availability 5 nines
3 replicas of data stored

azure allows 50k vm disks of a specific type per region in one subscription
integrated with availabilty sets and zones
2 types of encryption
sse --> serverside encryption , provided by azure storage service , is by default
ade --> azure disk encryption

There are 3 disk roles in Azure. These roles include data disks, OS disks, and temporary disks.
Data Disks
Data disks are managed disks that you attach to a virtual machine.
They're used to store applications and other sorts of data that you need.
 When you attach a data disk to a VM, it's registered as a SCSI drive.
You can assign a drive letter to a data disk just like any other physical disk in a physical server.
Data disks have a max capacity of 32 terabytes, and the number of data disks that you can attach
 to a virtual machine will be determined by the size of the virtual machine itself.

 Os disks
When you deploy a virtual machine, it's deployed with a single OS disk attached.
The OS disk, as you may have guessed, hosts the VM's operating system and boot volume.
The max capacity of an OS disk is four terabytes.

Temporary Disks
Temporary disks are probably the most misunderstood of the three disk types.
 Every VM contains a temporary disk. I should mention, however,
 that the temporary disk is not a managed disk.
 The temporary disk is not intended for the storage of important data.
 Instead, temporary disks are used to host things like page files and swap files.


There are four Azure storage services: Blob storage, Table storage, Queue storage, and File storage.
Azure File storage offers cloud-based SMB file shares in order to reduce rewrites when migrating legacy applications that rely on file shares.
