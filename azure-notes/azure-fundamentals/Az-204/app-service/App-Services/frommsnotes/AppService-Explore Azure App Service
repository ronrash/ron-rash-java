Limitations
App Service on Linux does have some limitations:


An App Service plan is the scale unit of the App Service apps.

If the plan is configured to run five VM instances, then all apps in the plan run on all five instances.
If the plan is configured for autoscaling, then all apps in the plan are scaled out together based on the autoscale settings.


when to scale up or down ?
The app is resource-intensive.
You want to scale the app independently from the other apps in the existing plan.
The app needs resource in a different geographical region.

================================================ ================================================================================================

only for dev and test purpose
Shared Compute -- free/shared, all apps run on same vm, all app are allocated some cpu quota, resources cannot scale out
Dedicated compute: basic standard premiumv2,v3 - run on dedicated vms,app share same vm within a plan , can scale out
Isolated -- dedicated vmm with dedicated azure vn, max scale and network isolation

The App Service plan is the scale unit of the App Service apps

Which of the following statements are true:
An app runs on all the VM instances configured in the App Service plan.
If multiple apps are in the same App Service plan, they all share the same VM instances.
All deployment slots also run on the same VM instances as the app in given App Service plan
You can improve app's performance if you put it in a new, empty App Service plan
