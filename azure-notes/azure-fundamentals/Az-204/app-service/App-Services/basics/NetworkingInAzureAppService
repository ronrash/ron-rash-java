Custom Domain
1-- Azure app has a defaut url at the end --> .azurewebsites.net
2. we need to change the pricing tier to a paid one as it supports having custom domain

Thinsg to do
Upgrade ur Pricing tier
resgiter domain name
can edit the dns record

Got to custom domains settings in ur app service and get the
custom domain verification id 2020320323023i203i230
and address id ip address --> suppose 20.40.202.27

In ur domain provide
go to dns records

@ --> rootname
Type NAME VALUE
A     @   20.40.202.27  value is ur ip address of the webapp in ur azure

if u want to set the subdomain name like
Type    NAME     VALUE
CNAME     www   cawebapp.azurewebsites.net  value is ur url  of the webapp in ur azure

eg
Type    NAME     VALUE
A        @       20.40.202.27
CNAME   www      cawebapp.azurewebsites.net

@ is the rootname
www is the subdomain

TXT is just additionl info whihc does not affect the resolution of ur doamin name
Need to creatw 2 txt records to prove to microsoft u own this domain and the subdomain

asuid -app service unique identifier

Type  Name       Value                  App Service Unique Identifier
TXT   asuid      2020320323023i203i230 {custom domain verification id }
TXT   asuid.www  2020320323023i203i230

NOw
got to azure app service--> webapp--> custom domain -- add ur custom domain
add the domain name like himaavan.com

CUSTOM DOMAIN            foot.com
Hostname record type     A record

validate button

To secure ur domain name u need to setup tls/ssl certificate settings

check ur plan
free and basic do not support the tls/ssl plans
Need to have tls/ssl certificate file which contains a private ke and public key
These pair of keys is used to encrypt/decrypt traffic between the website and the user over the internet
The certificate checks if the browser is interacting with website directly  prventing middle man attack

3. Create a Tls binding with ur custom domain

How to create a certificate ??
App Service Certifcate free ,,
provided by digcert checks for the authenticity of the certificate
or import form a third party

To create a certificate  --got to tls/settings on ur web service app--> private key certificate.pfx-->
--> click on create app service managed and add ur custom domain
Now bind tls/ssl to ur domain
there are 2 types of tls/ssl
1. Sni SSl --> binds  certificate using websites hostname,, more flexibilty and easy to configure ,, not used on very old browsers
2. Ip Based SSl --> binds the cert using websites ip address

sni is more useful
also select the htts only option in ur tls/ssl settings

what is tls mutual auth
for a website to know it is communication with a client and to a hacker use tls mutual auth
Tls Mutual Authentication is used when the website wants to know if the user is not a hacker is legitimate
used within an individual org becoz it requires that client devices have a client certficate

go to configuration and set client certificate mode to on
also need to add authentication code to ur app

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Inbound and outbound rules
restrict ip address

if u have resources in azure say vm  and want to connect to ur web app service u can use a service endpoint
azure db -----> app -- u can connect restrict access using a service endpoint rather than an ip address

A service endpoint is something u can enable on a subnet

U can create a private endpoint for ur app
azresurce --->private enpoint --->ur app
this helps to connect form on-prem as well

onprem--->azure vpn or azure express route ---> az resource--->private endpoint --> ur app

Hence private endpoints are recommended over the service endpoits

For outbound connections from ur app to onperm or az rosucres
1.u can have hybrid connection managers running on port 443
Secure and no requirement of azure express

2.Vnet integration 2 types
Regional Vnet Integration -- no instatallation ,
Gateway-Required Vnte -- erquired when ur app needs to connect to vnet in another region {doesnt allow onprem over express rout}


Goto app service --webapp -- networking -- vnet integration --> add vnet
if ur app is in the same region as vnet then nothing irequred the vnet should have an empty subnet
UR app --> VNet{azure app } --> vpn ---> onprem
