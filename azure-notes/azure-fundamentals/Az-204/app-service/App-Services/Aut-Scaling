Scaling out --> increasing the no of resources
Scaling in --> decreasing the no of resources
Scaling up --> changing the pricing tier to a premium tier
Scaling dow --> changing to a lower pricing pla like the free, or basic

App Service Plan
Free Basic Standard Premium



 scaling in/out and only availabe in basic plans and higher not on free and shared
 basic includes manual scaling
 Autscaling is withou human intervention is on standard palns and hire

 Service which handles Autscaling is Azure Monitor

 Autoscale via Appservice plan in Azure monitor
 or go in the Azuremonitor and use Autoscale service plan )


Autoscaling
Scale Condition -->  Action
Rule --> Virtual Machine

there can many rules
cpu precentage
memory percentage
data in
dat out
disk queue length = no of messages in the queue
wide variery of network metrics

eg
Rule is if cpu % == 75 in a 10 min period
Action --> scale to 1 or scale to maybe 3 vms

Cool down period --> no of mins to wait before scaling operation can begin
def = 5mins

eg
rule --> if cpu % is >-70% for 5 mins
action --> increase to 2 vms

Scale out will always win over scale in becoz of perfromance issues

Scale to a specific count -- based on scheduling ie time
i.e sacle to 5 vms on weekdays from 08:00 - 6pm
and scale to 1vm on weekends

questions
1. “cool down” period. This is the number of minutes to wait after a scaling operation before Monitor can scale again.
2. by default the cool down is for 5 mins
3. When creating rules, besides metrics, there’s the scaling action that you want it to take.
You can tell Monitor to scale out by exactly a certain number of VM instances, such as 1 in our example,
or scale out to a total number of instances, such as 3, or you can tell it to scale out by a percentage.
4. The way autoscaling works is that you can create one or more scale conditions that specify exactly
what will trigger Azure to add or remove virtual machines.
5. The service that actually handles autoscaling is Azure Monitor.
