Azure Blueprints automates the deployment of entire Azure environments.
A blueprint is a collection of Azure Resource Manager templates plus a few other details,
such as policies and user permissions. When a blueprint is assigned to a subscription,
it not only automates the creation of an environment, but it also keeps a record of the deployment.
This makes it a critical governance tool because it enables the tracking and auditing of deployments.

 If you currently have an application running on a Windows or Linux server,
 then the most straightforward way to migrate it to Azure is to do what's called a "lift and shift" migration.
  You lift the application from your on-premises server and shift it to a virtual server in the cloud.

Azure Functions, Azure Container Instances, and Azure DevOps are all components of Azure;
however, they are not the most relevant services for planning the migration from on-premises to the Azure cloud.

Microsoft also offers a solution called Azure Sphere to make your IoT devices more secure.
It includes certified chips, the Azure Sphere operating system, and the Azure Sphere Security Service,
all of which provide layers of protection for your IoT devices.
