You can launch the following from an action group:

An Azure Automation runbook,az functions,notification from azure event hubs,it service management tool.azure logic app

You cannot launch an Azure Container Instance.


Azure Activity Log holds data for 90 days.contains subscription-level events about a resource
A Log Analytics workspace hold data for  12 years.
While the Azure Activity Log is free, there is a cost for Log Analytics workspaces.


  You want to automate a process to review log data related to resource updates, to detect anomalies within the updates.
  You would like to utilize live dashboards to evaluate the log data quickly. What type of logs would you analyze, and with what Azure service?

  Process activity logs with Azure Event Hub. --> logs provide information about operations that have taken
                                                 place on resources within your Azure subscription.
                                   like  creation, modification, or deletion events.
                                   Activity logs are crucial for tracking changes and identifying noncompliant or disruptive resource updates.
  example - When a virtual machine is created, modified, or deleted, the activity log records who made the change,
  when it was made, and what specific operation was performed
  auditing and monitoring actions performed at the subscription level

   Azure Event Hub --> data streaming platform for ingesting events, used for real time processing and anomaly detection

  Process diagnostic logs with Log Analytics. -- diagnistoc logs -- detailed info about internals of an azure resource -->
   For a virtual machine, diagnostic logs can capture CPU usage, disk read/write operations, or the number of failed requests over time.
   for in-depth performance monitoring, troubleshooting, and identifying the root cause of issues within a resource.
   You can use Kusto Query Language (KQL) to build queries and detect anomalies in your log data

   log analytics -  It allows you to query logs, create custom alerts, and visualize data in dashboards.

  Process application logs with tables in Azure Storage.
  Process diagnostic logs with Power BI. Power BI is a business analytics service,  not designed to process and analyze logs directly

  Activity Logs -- operation performed on the azure resource -- like on vm creation deletion updation ,, who did what operation
                   aduting and monitoring
  Diagnostic Logs  -- internals of an azure resource -- like cp usage ,os, no of failed requests

  Log Anayltics worksapce --> keeps data for 12 years,costly, dashborads and kql use queries to and create alerts based on logs

  Enable application logging
  got app service logs -->

  What are app logs
  mainly to see errorneous code in pre-prod or prod
  logging to the file system is automatically disabled after 12 hours.

  Asp.net uses System.Diagnostics.Trace clas

  Trace.TraceError("Message"); // Writes an error message
  Trace.TraceWarning("Message"); // Writes a warning message
  Trace.TraceInformation("Message"); // Writes an information message
  Trace.WriteLine("Message"); // Writes a verbose message


  ASP.NET Core apps can run on either Windows or Linux.
  To log information to Azure app logs, use the logger factory class, and then use one of six-log levels:

  On windows
  logger.LogCritical("Message"); // Writes a critical message at log level 5
  logger.LogError("Message"); // Writes an error message at log level 4
  logger.LogWarning("Message"); // Writes a warning message at log level 3
  logger.LogInformation("Message"); // Writes an information message at log level 2
  logger.LogDebug("Message"); // Writes a debug message at log level 1
  logger.LogTrace("Message"); // Writes a detailed trace message at log level 0

  on linux  only error messages

  node.js app
  console.error("Message"); // Writes a message to STDERR.
  console.log("Message"); // Writes a message to STDOUT.

  App environment	Host	Log levels	                            Save location
  ASP.NET	        Windows	Error, Warning, Information, Verbose	File system, Blob storage
  ASP.NET Core	    Windows	Error, Warning, Information, Verbose	File system, Blob storage
  ASP.NET Core	    Linux	Error	                                 File system
  Node.js	        Windows	Error (STDERR), Information (STDOUT), Warning, Verbose	File system, Blob storage
  Node.js	        Linux	Error	                               File system
  Java	            Linux	 Error	                           File system

Application Logging
goto appservice --> monitoring section -->  Application logging (Filesystem) to On,
 and then set the Level to Error, Warning, Information, or Verbose.
     Logging to the file system will be automatically reset to Off after 12 hours.\

 Saving to blob storage is not available for Linux app logs.
