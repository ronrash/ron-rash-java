Azure Service Bus is a fully managed enterprise message broker for
reliable messaging between applications using queues and publish-subscribe topics.
 It is ideal for applications that require transactions, ordering, and handling of high-value messages
 where duplication or loss cannot occur.
 It enables secure and reliable communication, especially in hybrid cloud solutions

 Reliable asynchronous messaging: Messages are stored in a broker (queue) until ready to be processed.
 Advanced messaging features: FIFO, transactions, duplicate detection, dead-lettering, message routing, and filtering.
 At least once delivery: Guarantees message delivery with optional ordered delivery

. Order Processing in E-commerce
Scenario: An e-commerce website processes thousands of orders daily.
Each order needs to go through various steps like payment processing, inventory update, and shipment scheduling.
Solution: Use Azure Service Bus to create a queue for each order.
Messages in the queue represent different stages of the order lifecycle (payment, inventory, shipping).
This ensures that each step is processed sequentially, without missing or duplicating any orders.
Benefit: Guaranteed ordered message processing, duplicate detection, and handling of failures with
dead-letter queues for orders that fail to process.

 Financial Transactions in Banking
Scenario: A bank processes millions of transactions every day, such as fund transfers, payments, and account updates.
These operations must be handled with strict ordering, transactional integrity, and no message duplication.
Solution: Use Azure Service Bus to ensure that each transaction is processed in the correct order.
 The transaction feature ensures that the entire operation (debit and credit) is either completed successfully or rolled back in case of failure.
Benefit: Ensures at least once delivery, exactly-once processing in critical financial operations, and full rollback capabilities if something goes wrong.

Supply Chain Management
Scenario: A manufacturing company needs to coordinate various processes (e.g., order fulfillment, shipping, supplier coordination) that occur in different systems.
Solution: Use Service Bus Topics to implement a publish-subscribe model.
Different departments (e.g., logistics, procurement) subscribe to specific topics.
When a purchase order is completed, the relevant departments receive the notification and act on it.
Benefit: Enables reliable, decentralized communication with multiple subscribers and guaranteed message delivery,
 ensuring no order-related event is missed.

 Summary of Benefits in Real-World Use:
 Reliable message delivery: Guarantees at least once delivery, preventing message loss.
 FIFO: Ensures ordered message processing, important for processes that require strict sequence.
 Transactions: Enables rollback capabilities for multi-step processes.
 Hybrid integration: Securely connects on-premises and cloud systems.



 Use Case Examples (Combined Use):
 E-commerce platform:
 Service Bus: Processes orders and handles payment transactions.
 Event Hubs: Captures website telemetry (user clicks, product views).
 Event Grid: Responds to events such as item shipment notifications.

 Workflow Example:
 In a pipeline, Event Grid can trigger events when data is ingested by Event Hubs,
 sending the data for further processing or storage, such as in Azure Synapse Analytics.
