Event
An event is a lightweight notification about something that happened, without expectations on how it will be handled.

Types of Events:
Discrete Events:

Report a specific change in state (e.g., "a file was created").
Provide information about what happened but don't include the data that triggered it.
Example: A system notifies that a file was uploaded but doesn't include the file itself.
Best for serverless solutions that need to scale.

Series of Events:
Report a sequence of related conditions, often time-ordered.
Require multiple events to analyze a situation.
Example: A sequence of temperature readings from a sensor to analyze trends.
Key Difference: Discrete events notify something happened, while a series of events gives a sequence for analysis.

Message
Contains Data: A message includes the actual data that triggered it, unlike events that only notify something happened.
Expectation of Action: The publisher expects the consumer to process the message and take specific actions.
Contract: There is a contract or agreement between the sender and receiver on how the message will be handled.
Example: A service sends a message with file content, expecting the consumer to save it as a file and confirm when it's done.

A message contains the data and expects specific processing, while an event just notifies about something happening.

Azure Event Grid
fully managed (PAAS instance) pub/sub model
Publish-Subscribe Model: Publishers send events, but have no expectation of how they will be handled.
Subscribers choose which events to respond to.
Event-Driven Architecture: Enables reactive programming and serverless design
Reliability: Ensures at least once delivery of events.
Integration: Works with Azure and third-party services, simplifying event consumption without constant polling.
Dynamically scalable
Low cost
Serverless
Allows Event Grid to run on your Kubernetes clusters, either on-premises or in the cloud.

Scenarios
Automating Image Processing
Scenario: A company uploads thousands of images to an Azure Blob Storage container daily.
Solution: Event Grid can trigger a function whenever a new image is uploaded. The function processes the image (e.g., resizing, watermarking) and stores the processed image back in Azure Storage. No need for constant polling.
Benefit: Automatically reacts to new uploads without manual intervention or polling.

Monitoring Virtual Machines
Scenario: A company manages a large number of Azure virtual machines and needs to take action when a VM is started or stopped.
Solution: Event Grid can send events when a VM is started, stopped, or deleted.
These events can trigger automated workflows (e.g., backup, sending alerts, or logging activities).
Benefit: Automated, event-driven VM management without manual monitoring.

Serverless Workflow Automation
Scenario: An e-commerce site needs to automate order fulfillment workflows, such as updating inventory when a customer places an order.
Solution: Event Grid triggers different Azure functions when an order is placed, updating inventory, notifying shipping services,
and sending confirmation emails.
Benefit: Efficient order handling with serverless, event-driven automation.

Real-Time IoT Data Processing
Scenario: A company has IoT devices deployed in multiple locations, sending data about temperature, humidity, and equipment status.
Solution: Event Grid can route the IoT device data to different Azure services (like Event Hubs or Azure Functions)
 to process and analyze the data in real time.
Benefit: Event-driven data pipelines for real-time analytics without manual intervention.

Integration Between Multiple Applications
Scenario: A bces, such as CRM systems, billing systems, and customer support systems.
Solution: Event Grid can notify the CRM system when usiness needs to integrate multiple servia new customer is added and trigger workflows that create billing profiles and customer support records in other systems.
Benefit: Seamless integration between applications, ensuring all systems stay up-to-date.

Security Automation
Scenario: A company wants to monitor Azure resources for potential security breaches, like the deletion of a critical resource.
Solution: Event Grid can trigger security alerts or remediation actions (e.g., resource restoration or alerting administrators) when critical resources are deleted or modified.
Benefit: Enhanced security automation with real-time notifications and actions.

Log Monitoring and Alerting
Scenario: An enterprise wants to monitor application logs for specific events, like failures or errors, and respond automatically.
Solution: Event Grid can send notifications based on certain log entries (from Azure Monitor Logs) to trigger actions, such as restarting services or sending alerts to the operations team.
Benefit: Real-time log monitoring and automated responses to critical issues.
