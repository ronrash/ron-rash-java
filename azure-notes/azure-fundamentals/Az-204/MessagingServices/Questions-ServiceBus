1.Azure Service Bus creates a first-in, first-out (FIFO) guarantee?
To create a first-in, first-out (FIFO) guarantee in Service Bus, use sessions.
Message Sessions

2.Once the error has been logged and the necessary maintenance team has been alerted,
the message must be removed so that the monitoring system will not attempt to log it again

Azure Service Bus supports "Receive and Delete" mode, where messages are immediately consumed and removed from the queue.

3. For which cases parameter could be of type string?
QueueClient.SendAsync(new Message(param)
ServiceBusSender.SendMessagesAsync(new ServiceBusMessage(param)
EventHubProducerClient.SendAsync(new EventData(param))

EventData and ServiceBusMessage support both string and byte[],
Message is for byte[] only. Prefer byte[] for EventData.

4. Your application requires an event-based architecture that can handle millions of events per second with low latency.
 Additionally, the solution must provide support for custom topics and a maximum queue size of 30 GB.
 Which Azure messaging service would you choose?
 Azure event grid because it also
 Both Event Grid and Event Hub can handle millions of events per second.
  However, only Event Grid provides support for custom topics

5.You are designing a notification system using Azure Service Bus. Messages contain the following properties:

  Temperature: the temperature reading.
  Location: the location of the reading.
  You need to create a subscription that handles messages that are not generated from South America
  and not above 40 degrees. Which filter type should you implement?
 Answer SqlFilter - for complex queries

  A Correlation Filter is suitable for matching messages based on specific properties without complex logic. I

6.What strategies would minimize latency for a queue with small or moderate throughput when using a single client?
Use asynchronous operations
Disable client-side batching and batched store access
Set a high prefetch count

7.What strategies would minimize latency for a queue with small or moderate throughput when using a multiple clients?
Use asynchronous operations
Disable client-side batching and batched store access
Set the prefetch count to 0

8.Service Bus namespace in Azure need to retrieve the primary connection string for the "RootManageSharedAccessKey"
authorization rule within the namespace named "mynamespace" and the resource group named "myresourcegroup".

az servicebus namespace authorization-rule keys list
--name RootManageSharedAccessKey
--namespace-name mynamespace
--resource-group myresourcegroup
--query primaryConnectionString

9. creating a service bus
az servicebus namespace create --name $namespace --resource-group $resourceGroup --location eastus
az servicebus queue create --name myqueue --namespace-name $namespace --resource-group $resourceGroup

10.Which strategies would be effective for a queue with a large number of senders
Set a high prefetch count. Fetch multiple messages at once instead of one at a time. reduce round trip
Use asynchronous operations. sender and reciver will not have to wait for each other
Enable batched store access.Sends or receives multiple messages in a single operation.reduce network calls
Use a single factory per process for each sender. reduces connection factory .Lowers connection overhead and simplifies management, especially with many senders

11.
 The application is designed to connect patients with doctors for online consultations. The application needs to follow this workflow:

   A patient selects the medical specialty they need consultation in (e.g., Cardiology, Dermatology).
   Consultation requests are sent to all available doctors in that specialty.
   Only consultation requests for the selected specialty will appear for the doctor.
   The first doctor to accept the consultation removes it from the list of available consultations

Create a single Service Bus Namespace. A single namespace is sufficient to manage all the topics and subscriptions
A single Service Bus topic is ideal.
   Create a Service Bus Subscription for each medical specialty for which a doctor can receive messages. This allows doctors to subscribe to topics that are relevant to their specialty


12.You are developing a logging system that captures all messages in Azure Service Bus for auditing purposes.
The system will be used in the future and should not accept any messages at the moment.

FalseRuleFilter will always be false . it will not accept any message as of now
