Azure Storage Queue is a simple, highly scalable, cost-effective message queue service that allows
for asynchronous communication between different services. Given the scenarios you've described,
 let's evaluate the suitability of Azure Storage Queue for each service:


 FIFO (First-in, first-out): While Azure Storage Queue does not guarantee strict FIFO ordering,
 in practice, it often delivers in this manner. However, Service Bus or another solution might be more
  appropriate for mission-critical applications where strict FIFO is a necessity.

  Unlimited TTL: Azure Storage Queue supports this. Messages in Azure Storage Queue have a default TTL of 7 days,
  but you can set it to any period or effectively disable it (by setting a very long period)


  Preventing duplicate messages: Azure Storage Queue does not have built-in deduplication capabilities
  e maximum message size for Azure Storage Queue is 64 KB for a single message.
