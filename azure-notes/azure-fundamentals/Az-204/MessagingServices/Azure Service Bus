Azure Service Bus is a messaging service from Microsoft.
Service Bus is based upon the Publish/Subscribe messaging model,
 which is often referred to simply as Pub/Sub.
 Azure Service Bus supports Queues and Topics.

Queues are used for pushing messages to a single consumer.
Topics are used to distribute messages to multiple consumers in one-to-many message publishing scenarios.

The benefits of using Pub/Sub messaging include:
No need for expensive polling operations
Applications and services can be decoupled
Fault tolerance
Scalability

Queues
Use queues when you need to ensure that a message is processed exactly once and by only one consumer,
especially in task processing or sequential processing scenarios.
Messages in a queue are consumed by a single consumer.
Once a message is processed by a consumer, it is removed from the queue and cannot be processed by another consumer.

Topics
Use topics for broadcasting messages to multiple subscribers, e
specially in scenarios requiring updates to multiple components or real-time information distribution.

Messages published to a topic can be consumed by multiple subscribers.
Each subscriber gets a copy of the message, allowing for one-to-many message distribution.

they form the core messaging entities in Azure Service Bus
