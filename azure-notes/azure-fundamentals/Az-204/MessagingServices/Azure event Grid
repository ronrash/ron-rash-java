Endpoint validation is used to verify that the webhook endpoint specified by a subscriber is valid
and reachable before it can recieve events

Azure Event Grid uses a security feature called endpoint validation to verify that the webhook endpoint
specified by a subscriber is valid and reachable before it can receive events.
When an event subscription is created, Event Grid sends a subscription validation event to the specified endpoint,
 containing a validation code that the endpoint must echo back to the Event Grid service.
 This mechanism ensures that the endpoint is both reachable and authorized to receive events.

Queues are used for point-to-point communication, while topics are useful in publish/subscribe scenarios.

In Azure Service Bus, queues are used for point-to-point communication and store messages until
the receiving application is available to receive and process them.
On the other hand, topics are useful in publish/subscribe scenarios,
allowing multiple independent subscriptions that work like queues from the
receiver side and enabling subscribers to receive a copy of each message sent to the topic.



In Azure Event Hubs, a partition key is used to map incoming event data to specific partitions.
organize the data and keep related events together in the same partition,
ensuring that they are delivered in order of arrival.
Using a partition key can improve performance, reliability, and scalability of your event processing pipeline.


Questions
You need to ensure an application can receive events filtered by values in the data field in the advanced filtering options.
An advanced filter is used to filter events by values in the data fields and specify the comparison operator.
An event type filter is used to send only certain event types to the endpoint.
A subject filter is used to specify a starting or ending value for the subject.
Topics is not a type of filter; the event grid topic provides an endpoint where the source sends events.

============
Question -- You are developing a serverless application to process events from a third-party service. The third-party service sends events to a webhook URL whenever there are status changes in their system. Your task is to ensure that these events trigger an Azure Function to process them accordingly.

            Which of the following is the most efficient way to implement this?
Anseer - >Set up an Azure Function with an HTTP Trigger, and provide the function's URL as the webhook URL to the third-party service to receive and process the status change events directly.

Webhooks are typically user-defined HTTP callbacks used to invoke behavior in another system.
The third-party service sends events to a provided URL (webhook) whenever relevant events occur in their system, such as status changes.

The remaining choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

A Timer Trigger would need to periodically poll the third-party service, which is not as efficient as directly receiving the events via a webhook. This method could also lead to delays in processing events.
A Queue Trigger relies on messages being enqueued in a specific Azure Storage Queue, and there is no indication that the third-party service can enqueue messages to Azure Storage directly.
An HTTP Trigger is the most suitable as it can directly receive HTTP requests, making it ideal for receiving webhook events. By providing the URL of an HTTP-triggered function as the webhook URL to the third-party service, events can be received and processed as soon as they are sent, adhering to webhook best practices.
A Blob Trigger would be useful if the third-party service wrote information to Azure Blob Storage, but there is no indication of this in the given scenario.
