Endpoint validation is used to verify that the webhook endpoint specified by a subscriber is valid
and reachable before it can recieve events

Azure Event Grid uses a security feature called endpoint validation to verify that the webhook endpoint
specified by a subscriber is valid and reachable before it can receive events.
When an event subscription is created, Event Grid sends a subscription validation event to the specified endpoint,
 containing a validation code that the endpoint must echo back to the Event Grid service.
 This mechanism ensures that the endpoint is both reachable and authorized to receive events.

Queues are used for point-to-point communication, while topics are useful in publish/subscribe scenarios.

In Azure Service Bus, queues are used for point-to-point communication and store messages until
the receiving application is available to receive and process them.
On the other hand, topics are useful in publish/subscribe scenarios,
allowing multiple independent subscriptions that work like queues from the
receiver side and enabling subscribers to receive a copy of each message sent to the topic.



In Azure Event Hubs, a partition key is used to map incoming event data to specific partitions.
organize the data and keep related events together in the same partition,
ensuring that they are delivered in order of arrival.
Using a partition key can improve performance, reliability, and scalability of your event processing pipeline.


Questions
You need to ensure an application can receive events filtered by values in the data field in the advanced filtering options.
An advanced filter is used to filter events by values in the data fields and specify the comparison operator.
An event type filter is used to send only certain event types to the endpoint.
A subject filter is used to specify a starting or ending value for the subject.
Topics is not a type of filter; the event grid topic provides an endpoint where the source sends events.

Messages can be peeked at in the queue without removing them from the queue by calling the PeekMessages method of the QueueClient class.
 The Peek method of the QueueClient class is used with Azure Service Bus, not Azure Queue Storage.
 The ReceiveMessages method of the QueueClient class removes them from the queue.
 The ReceiveMessageAsync method of the QueueClient class is used with Azure Service Bus, not Azure Queue Storage.
