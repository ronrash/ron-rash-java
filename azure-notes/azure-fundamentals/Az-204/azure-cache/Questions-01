1.Which of the following would you store in Azure Cache for Redis?
Storing session state in Azure Cache for Redis is one of the common patterns / use cases

2.whihc feature in azure redis cache links 2 premimumm instance
Geo-replication  allowing data written to the primary cache to be replicated to the secondary linked cache

3.Data eviction in redis cache
Explicit Removal - data eviction is triggered by specific events
fifo - older data is less likely to be accessed and tasks are handled sequentially

4. set the expiration time for a key named userData to one minute and only apply the command if the key does not exist
EXPIRE userData 60 NX no key exist

5.web application that requires a highly scalable, fast, and premium method to store session state information.
transient network failures, provide advanced features, and support concurrent access to the same session state data

Cache for Redis at Premium Tier

Cache for Redis at Standard Tier same as above but cost effective

5.can you configure the eviction policy to target the least recently used keys first when the memory limit is met
volatile: if expiration is set; lru - least recently used

set a variable named "userData" to the value "JohnDoe123" and ensure that this value expires after one hour.
Redis commands you would use to achieve this
6. SET userData JohnDoe123
   EXPIRE userData 3600

7.  expire time resolution when applying a time to live (TTL) to a key in Redis?
1-millisecond

Private Caching is best suited for scenarios where data is specific to individual instances or users,
and speed is a priority. It's simpler but may lead to inconsistencies between different instances.
A single-user application that requires rapid access to user-specific data.
A desktop application that needs to store temporary files locally for quick retrieval.
A personal finance tool that caches individual user's financial data on their device for quick access.
