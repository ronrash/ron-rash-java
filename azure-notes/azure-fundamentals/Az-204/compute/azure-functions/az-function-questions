 You want the function to be triggered when new data is inserted into an Azure Cosmos DB
 and then have the function send a message to an Azure Service Bus Queue. ?

 ans - A Cosmos DB Trigger is designed to respond to changes in Azure Cosmos DB

 remaining choices are incorrect
A Timer Trigger could periodically check for new data, but would cause delay as  new data insertions in Azure Cosmos DB,
An HTTP Trigger would require an external call every time new data is inserted
A Service Bus Queue Trigger would be responding to messages being added to the Service Bus Queue, not initiating messages to it
