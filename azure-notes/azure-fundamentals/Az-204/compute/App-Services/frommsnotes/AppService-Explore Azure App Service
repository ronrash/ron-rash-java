What is an app service ?
Paas Offering 0r hhtp based service todeploy web applications, mobile apps,desktops easily scalable like changing ram,cores

The languages, and their supported versions, are updated regularly.

Limitations
App Service on Linux does have some limitations:

App Service on Linux isn't supported on Shared pricing tier.
The Azure portal shows only features that currently work for Linux apps. As features are enabled, they're activated on the portal.
When deployed to built-in images, your code and content are allocated a storage volume for web content, backed by Azure Storage.
The disk latency of this volume is higher and more variable than the latency of the container filesystem.

Apps that require heavy read-only access to content files may benefit from the custom container option,
which places files in the container filesystem instead of on the content volume.

An App Service plan is the scale unit of the App Service apps.
If the plan is configured to run five VM instances, then all apps in the plan run on all five instances.
If the plan is configured for autoscaling, then all apps in the plan are scaled out together based on the autoscale settings.


when to scale up or down
The app is resource-intensive.
You want to scale the app independently from the other apps in the existing plan.
The app needs resource in a different geographical region.

================================================ ================================================================================================

The pricing tier of an App Service plan determines what App Service features you get and how much you pay for the plan.
 There are a few categories of pricing tiers:

Shared compute: Free and Shared, the two base tiers, runs an app on the same Azure VM as other App Service apps, including apps of other customers.
 These tiers allocate CPU quotas to each app that runs on the shared resources, and the resources can't scale out.
Dedicated compute: The Basic, Standard, Premium, PremiumV2, and PremiumV3 tiers run apps on dedicated Azure VMs.
 Only apps in the same App Service plan share the same compute resources.
  The higher the tier, the more VM instances are available to you for scale-out.
Isolated: The Isolated and IsolatedV2 tiers run dedicated Azure VMs with dedicated Azure Virtual Networks.
It provides network isolation on top of compute isolation to your apps.
It provides the maximum scale-out capabilities.

only for dev and test purpose
Shared Compute -- free/shared, all apps run on same vm, all app are allocated some cpu quota, resources cannot scale out
Dedicated compute: basic standard premiumv2,v3 - run on dedicated vms,app share same vm within a plan , can scale out
Isolated -- dedecatid vm with dedicated azure vn, max sscale and network isolation
