 ------------overview-------
 App Service is PAAS ,, manages underlying software

 App service plan --> os , pricing tier ,region

 The Isolated tier gives you a private, dedicated environment that’s in its own virtual network.

If scaling out doesn’t solve performance issues,
then you can switch your plan to a pricing tier that has more powerful instances and/or a higher limit on the number of instances you can have. ]
This is called scaling up, and it’s very easy to do.
