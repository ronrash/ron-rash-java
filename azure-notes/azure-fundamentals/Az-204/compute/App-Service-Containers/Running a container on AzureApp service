Steps

Create an instance of Azure Container registry
Build a container image
Upload it to a conatiner registry
Deploy it from the conatiner registry to Azure app service
Connect and test ur app

what is a Docker container ??
A self-contained software environment that includes an application and all of its dependencies

Most containers deployed to Azure App Service use the _____ operating system.
Linux

For you to deploy a container on Azure App Service, the pricing tier for your service plan has to be at least _____.
BAsic

Azure Container registry  provides a central location for storing container images.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Conatiner related service in Azure
Azure containerInstance -->  its like the docker ,, which creates docker like containers for ur service, foucs on appp dev and deployments

Aks -- managemet of theses containers, container orchestration
Azure Container Registry ---> central repo for manging these container ,, just like docker registry,, supports docker Swarm , kubernetes
Azure App Service --> manage web app, mobile app on linux or windows based systems, auto scaling load balacning and integrate with Ados
Azure Service Fabric is a distributed systems platform that allows you to build and operate scalabe distributed apps, easy to
package ,deploy microservices

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Anatomy of Dockerfile -- Skelteon of ur app ,, text file
Used by docker build to create ur image
FROM ubuntu
LABEL maintainer rohitprashar21@gmail.com --> email of the person who maintains this
ADD appsetup / --> this will add a file called appsetuo into the root folder of the image being created
Run jacva -jar  adc.jar
CMD["echo","Hi Everybody!"]

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Muti Stage builds
Prior to multi stage buidls ,, keep the image size low was a challenge
u can use mutiple from ,, that is using a build from one stage to use the image in another satge

FROM golang:1.7.3 AS builder --> thsi can be used in another stage this is a named stage
WORKDIR /go/src/github.com
RUN
COPY app.go .
RUN
FROM

When u build an image u dont have to build the entire docker file including every stage
u can specify a single target build stage

eg
docker build --target builder -t myimagename/something:latest

--> --tagret option tells docker build to create an image up ti the builder stage

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Best practices for Multiple stage builds
1.Avoid large complex containers -- separate images for website ,db,cache
eg u can scale website ,, leaving db container alone

2. Avoid unnecessary packages
3. choose an appropriate base image
4. avoid including app data

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Create an azure container registry
search for container registry
create -- name -- subs, rg location pricing tier
goto repositories

login to ur acr ie azure container registry
from azure cli
az ac login --name <nameofurcontainerregistry>
az ac login --name ron-acr
login succeded

Deploy a docker image app  to the azure conatier registry

Login to the docker terminal
run or pull the image -- this pulls from the docker hub
docker pull hello-world

push this image to docker containe rregistry, before that we need to tag it with fully qualified domain name
docker tag <image-name> <acr>/<image-name>:version
docker tag hello-world ron-acr.azurecr.io/hello-world:v1

now push
docker push ron-acr.azurecr.io/hello-world:v1

To ocnfirm
go to the portal --> container registries --> look at the app

to run this
docker run ron-acr.azurecr.io/hello-world:v1
