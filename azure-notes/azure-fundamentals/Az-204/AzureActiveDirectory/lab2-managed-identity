Managed Identity provides an application identity to the PaaS or SaaS offering in the Azure
that allows you to connect to any Azure service that supports RBAC access through Azure AD.

Azure allows you to create two types of managed identities:

System-assigned: Azure services enabled you to create an identity directly on the service instance.
The lifecycle of the identity is tied to the resource. Deleting the resource also deletes the attached identity.

User-assigned: You can also create an identity manually and assign it to a resource in Azure.
 One identity can be assigned to more than one resource and the original identity is managed separately from the attached resources.

In this lab step, you will add application settings to the web app with Key Vault reference using the Azure Portal.

Steps
1. In the Azure Portal search bar, enter app services and click App Services under Services
and select the only listed web app resources with name similar to calabcal###:

2. click browse to see the forntend of the web app
The web frontend will fail to load as the web app is unable to find the required application settings for the Cosmos DB connection.
 You will fix it in the next instruction.

3. To understand the secret reference flow, click Identity from the left blade menu and select User assigned on the right hand side window:
The web app is assigned a user-assigned type managed identity that creates a service principal in the Azure tenant.
 This enables other resources to add permissions to the service principal, ultimately allowing the web app to access the resource as well.
A Key Vault secret access permission has been added for the same identity to access the secrets programmatically:

4 .Click Configuration under Settings and click + New application settings to add the application settings:
A Key Vault reference is of the form @Microsoft.KeyVault({referenceString}),
 where {referenceString} is replaced by either SecretUri=secretUri
 or a combination of VaultName, Secret Name and/or Secret version.

 Use the following information to add the application settings and click OK once done:

 Name: Enter constr
 Value: Enter @Microsoft.KeyVault(SecretUri=####) while replacing the # with the Secret Identifier URL copied from the Key Vault secret version in the previous lab step.

5. Click + New application setting and add 2 more app settings:

   App Setting 1

   Name: Enter database
   Value: Enter @Microsoft.KeyVault(SecretUri=####) while replacing the # with the secret identifier from the database-name secret in the key vault.
   App Setting 2

   Name: Enter container
   Value: Enter @Microsoft.KeyVault(SecretUri=####) while replacing the # with the secret identifier from the container-name secret in the key vault.
   The application settings will look like this when the settings are added:

 The Source value specifying the Key vault Reference confirms that the secrets are fetched from the key vault.

 Click Save > Continue from the top menu items once done.
