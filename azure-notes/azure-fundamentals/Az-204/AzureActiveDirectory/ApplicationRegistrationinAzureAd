Configure Azure Ad Application proxy
Azure ad offers a app proxy service which users can use to conect on -prem servers with their azure ad account

What are we going to do
Create an on-prem env
We will use azure portal to add the on-prem IAs app to our Azure Ad Tenant
We will install the proxy conenctor on a windows server in our local directory and register it with app proxy
We will verify that a test user can sign on to th application by using azure ad account
To use application proxy we need a windows server and also we need a connector
The proxy connector is an agent which manages the outbound connection from the app proxy to the on-perm web servers

Steps
Use an admin account
goto azure active directory ---> application proxy --> download the connector service and install it ,, verify if te connector is installed
goto azure active directory ---> application proxy {here we will see the new connector}

lets prepare our on-prem environment -- our app added to ad
goto azure active directory ---> enterprise app -> on-prem iss web-app --> give necessary details name , internal web url,

Test our app
test a user --> goto azure active directory --> getting started --> assign a user for testing -> add a user --> select a grp and assign

to test
opne a icnognito window ,, usinh the exernal url for the web app
sigin using azure creds and then we are propmted to sign in into our internal application {add the user details}

app password
Some applications don't support two-step verification. To use these applications, use the app passwords feature.

When using Microsoft Entra multi-factor authentication,
you can allow your users to mark devices as trusted.
 What this does is permit users to opt out of two-step verification for a set number of days on their regular devices.

The password option is available for both MFA and SSPR.
Security questions and email addresses can be used only with SSPR.
SMS and voice call are both available for MFA usage,
 as well as SSPR usage;
 however, app passwords can only be used for MFA,
  and even in those cases can only be used in certain conditions.
