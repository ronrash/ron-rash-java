Policy definitions are simple XML documents that describe a sequence of statements to apply to requests and responses.

The policy XML configuration is divided into inbound, backend, outbound, and on-error sections.

<policies>
  <inbound>
    <!-- statements to be applied to the request go here -->
  </inbound>
  <backend>
    <!-- statements to be applied before the request is forwarded to
         the backend service go here -->
  </backend>
  <outbound>
    <!-- statements to be applied to the response go here -->
  </outbound>
  <on-error>
    <!-- statements to be applied if there is an error condition go here -->
  </on-error>
</policies>

Any remaining steps in the inbound, backend, or outbound sections are skipped

Review the error using the context.LastError property.
Inspect and customize the error response using the set-body policy.
