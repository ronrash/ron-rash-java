Partition key -- partition where the item is stored in cosmos db


Question
 The database will have a 'UserOrders' container, where each item represents an order made by a user.
 Given that user queries will always retrieve the entire order history of a specific user and
 there are millions of users with varying number of orders, you need to ensure that these queries are as efficient as possible.

 Answer
 Using the UserID as the partition key means that all orders from a specific user are stored together in the same partition


Question .There are four replicas of a multi-tier application separated into four resource groups with the following specifications:
Each resource group is in a separate region - East US, West US, West Central US, and South Central US.
Each resource group includes a replica of a three-tier application replica comprised of five VMs: two front-end VMs, two mid-tier application VMs,
 and one back-end database VM.
You want to increase the resilience of your database solution by replacing the database hosted on
an ARM virtual machine with Cosmos DB. You want to offer a consistent experience for each customer while minimizing the latency of your responses.

Strong Consistency -- will return the most recent version of an item.
 therefore it will be slow and will be very difficualt to achieve in a distributed env
Eventual -- not recent version ,, can be old,lowest latency ,worst consisteny and for nosql dbs
Consisten Prefix -- same but with  ,, nevers ee out of order writes latency and cost go up
session -- Session consistency guarantees consistency for each client session.
           So the client will never see data older than what they have written during a session
            never worry about conflicts between multiple clients
           lwowest latency reads and writes. It’s also by far the most popular consistency level chosen by Cosmos DB customers.

Bounded staleness -  reads may lag behind writes by a limited amount of time. same strong consistency,
               but it allows you to distribute your database across regions and has lower latency.
               This is the second most popular consistency level chosen by customers.

Session Consistency is Best for Your Scenario
Global Distribution :  users who are connecting to the nearest data center.
cusstomer experience : Each customer likely has their own session (or connection) to the database, and Session Consistency ensures that within a session,
  a user always sees their most recent updates.

Can you create another database named Db2 inside Account1 for the graph data?
NO each account can only contain one type of data

The API determines the type of account to create.
 Azure Cosmos DB provides five APIs: Core (SQL) and
 MongoDB for document data,
 Gremlin for graph data, Azure Table, and Cassandra. Currently, you must create a separate account for each API.


 ===================== ==============      ========
 When creating a Cosmos DB account, you indicate which consistency level you would like to follow:
 Strong, Bounded Staleness, Session, Consistent Prefix and Eventual.
 How can a developer force Strong consistency on a query when the database itself is Eventual consistency?

 Set the ConsistencyLevel property of QueryRequestOptions when making the query.
 it has get/set ConsistencyLevelProperty

Here’s a short and simple explanation of each feature within the context of an Azure Cosmos DB Change Feed Processor:

1. Dead Letter Queue
What it is: A Dead Letter Queue is used to store failed messages or documents that couldn’t be processed, preventing continuous retries.
Scenario: If a specific document in a batch keeps failing, it will be moved to the Dead Letter Queue so the rest of the batch can be processed, avoiding endless retries.
Usage: In your case, it would stop the failing document from causing repeated retries, allowing other documents to be processed.
2. Lease Container
What it is: The Lease Container tracks the progress of processing the change feed by multiple workers.
Scenario: Multiple Azure Functions (or processors) read from the change feed, and the Lease Container ensures
that each worker only processes its own portion of data, avoiding duplication.
Usage: It manages the coordination of reading batches of documents across multiple workers.
3. Life Cycle Notifications
What it is: Life Cycle Notifications allow you to track the start and completion of change feed processing for each batch.
Scenario: You can log or trigger actions when a batch starts or finishes processing, such as logging progress or handling completion events.
Usage: Useful for tracking processing progress or triggering specific actions after each batch is processed.
4. Change Feed Estimator
What it is: The Change Feed Estimator gives you insights into the backlog of unprocessed documents in the change feed.
Scenario: If a large batch of documents is failing to process, the Estimator can show how far behind the system is,
helping you decide if more compute power is needed.
Usage: Helps in monitoring how much data is left to process, especially useful in case of performance bottlenecks.
