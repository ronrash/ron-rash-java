You've already implemented the API, which includes endpoints for submitting audio files
and retrieving transcribed text. You decide to use the Swagger format to document the API within Azure APIM.


Generate a Swagger file from your codebase, and then import this file into APIM;
 next, enrich the documentation with examples directly in the Swagger file before the import.

 Swagger (OpenAPI) is a tool specifically designed for documenting APIs.
 By generating a Swagger file from the codebase, you ensure that the documentation is consistent
 with the actual API implementation. Enriching this file with detailed examples before importing
  it into APIM ensures that all necessary details are included and presented clearly,
   providing a complete and accurate documentation set from the start.
