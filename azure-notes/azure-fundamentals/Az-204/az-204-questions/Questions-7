Question .There are four replicas of a multi-tier application separated into four resource groups with the following specifications:
Each resource group is in a separate region - East US, West US, West Central US, and South Central US.
Each resource group includes a replica of a three-tier application replica comprised of five VMs: two front-end VMs,
two mid-tier application VMs, and one back-end database VM.
You want to increase the resilience of your database solution by replacing the database hosted on an ARM virtual machine with Cosmos DB.
You want to offer a consistent experience for each customer while minimizing the latency of your responses.

Strong Consistency -- will return the most recent version of an item.
therefore it will be slow and will be very difficualt to achieve in a distributed env
Eventual -- not recent version ,, can be old,lowest latency ,worst consisteny and for nosql dbs
Consisten Prefix -- same but with  ,, nevers ee out of order writes latency and cost go up
session -- Session consistency guarantees consistency for each client session.
           So the client will never see data older than what they have written during a session
            never worry about conflicts between multiple clients
           lwowest latency reads and writes. Itâ€™s also by far the most popular consistency level chosen by Cosmos DB customers.

Bounded staleness -  reads may lag behind writes by a limited amount of time. same strong consistency,
               but it allows you to distribute your database across regions and has lower latency.
               This is the second most popular consistency level chosen by customers.


 2. configure the Azure App Service to utilize the SSL certificate for your custom domain
 Navigate to the 'TLS/SSL settings' in your App Service, upload the private certificate (.pfx) file,
 and then bind it to your custom domain using the 'Add TLS/SSL binding' option.


 3. correctly retrieves a key named "DatabaseEncryptionKey" from the Azure Key Vault
  from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
  from azure.keyvault.keys import KeyClient

  credential = DefaultAzureCredential() -->  imports the necessary classes: DefaultAzureCredential for authentication and KeyClient for operations on keys.
  key_client = KeyClient(vault_url="https://myvaultname.vault.azure.net/", credential=credential)
  key = key_client.get_key("DatabaseEncryptionKey")

 4.  clients can only access the APIs relevant to their purchased products.
  To achieve this, you decide to utilize the subscription feature in APIM with a product scope.

  define a single subscription for each product in APIM.
  When a client subscribes to a product, they get access to all APIs within that product using the single subscription key.

  In Azure API Management, a product is a grouping of one or more APIs.
  When you create a subscription for a product, it allows the subscriber to use any API contained within that product.
  This approach is much simpler for the client, as they only need to manage a single subscription key,
   and it aligns well with the product-centric business model.
