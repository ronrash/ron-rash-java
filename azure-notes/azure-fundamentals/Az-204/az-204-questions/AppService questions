1. enable low-latency, full-duplex communication channels, the application relies on WebSockets.
Your task is to ensure that WebSockets support is enabled for the Azure App Service hosting the chat application.

commands   for azure app service

// for configuration cli commands in web app in azure app service
az webapp config set --name ChatApp --resource-group MyResourceGroup --websockets-enabled true

2. setting up a new environment for a web application that connects to a MySQL database.
  az webapp config set --name <nameof the webap > --resource-group <resource group name>
   --connection-strings '{"MySqlConnectionString" :{"value": "my-connection-string", "type": "MySql"}}'}'

  az webapp config set command allows you to set configuration properties in azure app service

  az webapp config set --name <app_name> --resource-group <resource_group> --php-version 8.0
or
 az webapp config set --name <nameof the webap > --resource-group <resource group name>
   --connection-strings '{"MySqlConnectionString" :{"value": "my-connection-string", "type": "MySql"}}'}'

scenario : If your web app is running on a specific version of the .NET Core runtime and you need
 to update it to a newer version, you would use this command to change the configuration.

  az appservice web config is invalid

  az webapp config appsettings set  ---> command sets application settings for a web app ,,
  they are basically key value pairs such as env variable or connection
  az webapp config appsettings set --name <app_name> --resource-group <resource_group> --settings <key>=<value>
 If your web app needs to read a database connection string or an API key from its environment, you would use this command to set those values.


 ====================================================================================================

 az webapp config set --name ChatApp --resource-group MyResourceGroup --websockets-enabled true
 to enable WebSockets for an Azure App Service,--websockets-enabled true this is the command



 =================
 Question is Your application needs to leverage a third-party API for user authentication and authorization.
  You have been provided the API's endpoint, client ID, and client secret.
  You aim to configure your Azure App Service to integrate this API for user authentication.

 In the Azure portal, navigate to the App Service, under 'Configuration',
 add an application setting named 'AUTH_API_ENDPOINT' with the provided endpoint value,
 then add 'API_CLIENT_ID' and 'API_CLIENT_SECRET' with the corresponding values.

 other choices
 'Authentication / Authorization' feature in Azure App Service allows for integrating authentication providers like Microsoft Entra ID, Facebook, and Google.
  'Deployment Center' is used for continuous deployment from source control solutions, such as GitHub or Azure Repos
  'VNET Integration' allows an App Service to access resources in a virtual network but doesn't handle third-party API authentication and authorization
