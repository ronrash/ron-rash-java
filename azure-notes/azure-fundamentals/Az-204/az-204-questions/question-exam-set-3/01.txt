1.As a cloud solutions developer, you're working with an existing codebase that uses Azure's legacy Storage SDK.
During a service disruption at the primary data center, you need to configure the Azure Storage client to retry any failed requests
on the secondary location using RA-GRS storage.

Which LocationMode option from the Microsoft.Azure.Storage.RetryPolicies.LocationMode class should you use?
LocationMode.PrimaryThenSecondary allows requests to first try the primary location and then retry at the secondary location if necessary.

2.You establish an API Management (APIM) gateway and incorporate an existing App Services API app within it.
 Your goal is to limit each client application to a maximum of 1000 calls to the API on an hourly basis.".
  Which policies could achieve this requirement?

  rate-limit-by-key and quota-by-key can limit numbers of requests
  <rate-limit-by-key calls="1000" renewal-period="3600" counter-key="@(context.Subscription.Id)" />

  <quota-by-key calls="1000" renewal-period="3600" counter-key="@(context.Subscription.Id)" />

3. Stateless applications are easier to scale horizontally.
 Because each request is processed independently, you can easily add more instances of the application to handle more requests.

4. Specify the correct parameter for ServiceBusSender.SendMessagesAsync() if text is of type string.
   new ServiceBusMessage(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(text))

 5.In your organization, you are working on an ASP.NET web application that is hosted on a development server
  within the company's internal network. Before transitioning the application to the production server,
  you must gather performance data from various global locations. What action should you take?

  Implement a URL ping test using Application Insights.
  Application Insights provides the ability to monitor, detect, and diagnose performance issues,
  including those related to geographic locations
  URL ping test specifically allows you to test the responsiveness of a web application from different regions,
  along with capturing performance metrics from multiple geographies.

 6. What are the Azure CDN configuration propagation times for Standard (Verizon):
     10 minutes

 7.In ASP.NET Core 3, in which file do you configure Authentication and Authorization?
