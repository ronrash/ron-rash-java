1.
A .NET application needs to receive a message each time an Azure virtual machine finishes processing data. The messages must NOT persist after being processed by the receiving application.
You need to implement the .NET object that will receive the messages.
Which object should you use?
• A. QueueClient - point to pint communitcaion,once processed the message is deleted, interacts with azure service bus queue
• B. SubscriptionClient -  allows multiple receivers to receive the same message (publish/subscribe model
• C. TopicClient -send messages to an Azure Service Bus topic, where they can be received by multiple subscribers. again pub/sub model
• D. CloudQueueClient -  used with Azure Storage Queues less rich features

2. You are maintaining an existing application that uses an Azure Blob GPv1 Premium storage account.
    Data older than three months is rarely used.
   Data newer than three months must be available immediately. Data older than a year must be saved but does not need to be available immediately.
   You need to configure the account to support a lifecycle management rule that moves blob data to archive storage for data not modified in the last year.
   Which three actions should you perform in sequence?

   1.Upgrade the storage account to GPv2 - bcoz GPv1 does not support tierin
   data tiering between hot, cool, and archive is supporte
   2. Copy the data to be archived to a Standard GPv2 storage account and then delete the data from the original storage account
   3.Change the storage account access tier from hot to cool
