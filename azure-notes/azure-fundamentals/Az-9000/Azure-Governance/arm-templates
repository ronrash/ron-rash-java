Azure Resource Manager ARm
zure Resource Manager (ARM) is the deployment and management service for Azure.

When a user sends a request from any of the Azure tools, APIs, or SDKs, Arm recieves the request , arm authenticates the request and sends it to the
azure services
You see consistent results and capabilities in all the different tools because all requests are handled through the same API.


Arm benefits Or what can u do
A Resource Manager template is a JSON file that defines what you want to deploy to Azure.
Deploy, manage, and monitor all the resources for your solution as a group,
apply tags to ur resources , aply access control for ur resources , clarify ur orgnaization illings


ARM templates and Bicep are two examples of using infrastructure as code with the Azure Resource Manager to maintain your environment.


ARM templates
Use arm templates to descibe what resource u need on azurre like in a json format
the deployment code is verified before u run it, resoruces will connected correctly ,,s uppose u wnat 100 resruces paralelely it will help u
create those ,, same as terraform
Templates can even execute PowerShell and Bash scripts before or after the resource has been set up.

Benfits
decalaratove syntax means declare what you want to deploy not actaul programmin commands on how do it
Repeatable results:
Orchestration - not worry about complexities
Modular files:
Extensibility


Bicep
Bicep is a language that uses declarative syntax to deploy Azure resources.
Defines infra and configuration Then, ARM deploys that environment based on your Bicep file.
 While similar to an ARM template, which is written in JSON, Bicep files tend to use a simpler, more concise style.

Support for all resource types and API versions:
