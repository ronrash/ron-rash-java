Azure Policy
Azure Policy is a service in Azure that enables you to create, assign, and manage policies that control or audit your resources
enforce different rules across your resource configurations

Azure Policy define policies
u can define both individual and group polices called initiatves
u set policies on each level subscription resource group resource
Azure Policies are inherited
eg : if you set an Azure Policy on a resource group, all resources created within that resource group will automatically receive the same policy

Azure Policy comes with built-in policy and initiative definitions for Storage, Networking, Compute, Security Center, and Monitoring
eg a policy that allows only a certain size for the virtual machine so when u create a new vm that policy will be invoked

Azure Policy can automatically remediate/correct noncompliant resources and configurations
eg  if all resources in a certain resource group should be tagged with AppName tag and a value of "SpecialOrders,"
Azure Policy will automatically apply that tag if it is missing

If you have a specific resource that you donâ€™t want Azure Policy to automatically fix, you can flag that resource as an exception

Azure Policy  integrates with Azure DevOps for continuous integration and delivery pipeline policies
 that pertain to the pre-deployment and post-deployment phases of your applications.
