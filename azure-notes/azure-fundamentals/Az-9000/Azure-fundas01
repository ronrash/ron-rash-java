An Azure region contains a set of data centers that are connected by using a low-latency network.

There are different payment options in Azure including pay-as-you-go (PAYG),
Enterprise Agreement (EA),
and Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA) accounts.
Your Azure costs are ‘per subscription’. You are charged monthly for all resources in a subscription.
Therefore, to use different payment options per department, you will need to create a separate subscription per department.
You can create multiple subscriptions in a single Azure Active Directory tenant.

A resource group is a logical container for Azure resources.
Resource groups make the management of Azure resources easier.
With a resource group, you can allow a user to manage all resources in the resource group,
 such as virtual machines, websites, and subnets.
 The permissions you apply to the resource group apply to all resources contained in the resource group.
