consumption-based model
 Capital expenditure CapEx is typically a one-time, up-front expenditure like  building a datacenter, or buying a company vehicle
Opexor operational expenditue - using up for cloud services are all examples

Cloud computing falls under OpEx because cloud computing operates on a consumption-based model
he consumption model
No upfront costs.
No need to purchase and manage costly infrastructure that users might not use to its fullest potential.
The ability to pay for more resources when they're needed.
The ability to stop paying for resources that are no longer needed.


Compare cloud pricing models
    Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet by using a pay-as-you-go pricing model

Plan and manage your operating costs.
Run your infrastructure more efficiently.
Scale as your business needs change


Describe the benefits of high availability and scalability in the cloud

High availability -  resources are available when needed,ensuring maximum availability,regardless of disruptions or events that may occur
These guarantees are part of the service-level agreements (SLAs).

Scalability refers to the ability to adjust resources to meet demand.
Because the cloud is a consumption-based model, you only pay for what you use.
If demand drops off, you can reduce your resources and thereby reduce your costs.


Vertical scaling - to add more CPUs or RAM to the virtual machine ,, more power
Horizontal Scaling - add additional virtual machines or containers, scaling or adding more resources
