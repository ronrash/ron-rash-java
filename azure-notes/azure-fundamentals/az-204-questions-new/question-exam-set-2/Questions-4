1. register web app
  steps are 1. In app registration select new registration
            2. select the azure ad instance -- under uri select the typeof app ur building , web or public client mobile desktop
            3. create the new application adn provide account type name and redirect url


2. for azure search 2 object used are
    SearchIndexClient and SearchServiceClient
    sample code

    SearchServiceClient searchServiceClient = CreateSearchServiceClient(configuration)
    SeacrhIndexClient indexclient = serviceclient.indexexs.getClient("hotels")

    for azure search  there are diff types of params
    QueryType
    facets
    filter
    searchMode
    QueryType property of the SearchParameters class
    The default is 'simple'. Use 'full' if your query uses the lucene query sntax

 3.  to implement multi-factor authentication by making use of a conditional access policy
     conditional access policy must be applied or assigned to Users and Groups.
     The conditional access policy must be applied when users access the Azure portal, which is a cloud app. That is: Microsoft Azure Management
     Access control must require multi-factor authentication when granting access

     simplified version
     You want all users in the "IT Team" group to use MFA when they log into the Azure portal.
     Create a Conditional Access Policy targeting that group, set Microsoft Azure Management as the cloud app,
      and configure the access control to enforce MFA.

4 .  connect to the SQL database via Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
     also developers should use their on-premises Active Directory account for authentication
 ans -->    Active Directory integrated authentication.
 example - ff a developer in your company needs to connect to the SQL database using their corporate credentials,
 they can select "Active Directory - Integrated" in SSMS and authenticate without entering separate credentials.

 5. allow recovery of an accidental deletion of the key vault or key vault objects for 90 days after deletion
     az keyvault update --enable-soft-delete true --enable-purge-protection true

     az keyvault update --enable-soft-delete true --enable-purge-protection true

Soft delete: Allows you to recover a deleted key vault or key vault objects within 90 days.
Purge protection: Ensures that even after deletion, the key vault or its objects cannot be permanently deleted (purged) before the retention period (90 days).


     Purge protection is an optional Key Vault behavior and is not enabled by default
     Purge protection can only be enabled once soft-delete is enabled.
     When purge protection is on, a vault or an object in the deleted state cannot be purged until the retention period has passed.
     Soft-deleted vaults and objects can still be recovered, ensuring that the retention policy will be followed.
     default retention period is 90 days, once saved it cannot be changed

 6.  https://learn.microsoft.com/sv-se/cli/azure/monitor/metrics/alert?view=azure-cli-latest --
     the question here was whenever ur app use cpu more than 85 % over a 5 min period raise an alert
     ans --> --window-size(Time to aggregate measures in ##h##m##sformat.)     5 mins
               avg percentage cpu are the metrics used

 7. what is a san ,, can it replace cdn
   A Storage Area Network (SAN) is a dedicated network that provides access to consolidated, block-level data storage.
    It is used to increase the availability of data and improve the performance of applications that require access to shared data.
    However, SANs do not provide features to ensure high availability of web applications, nor do they provide a
    mechanism to store data in the geographic location nearest to the user.

    it cannot replace a cdn

    A company uses a SAN to connect multiple servers to a central storage system.
    This allows the servers to access shared data quickly, improving the performance of their internal databases and applications.

    A video streaming service uses a CDN to store copies of videos in data centers around the world.
    When a user plays a video, the CDN delivers it from the server closest to the user's location, reducing load times and improving playback quality.
    Global content distribution for faster access to users worldwide

   8.Activity Log Signal Type: Monitors operations on resources, useful for tracking resource management events but not for performance metrics.
     Application Log Signal Type: Captures logs generated by applications, allowing for alerting based on specific log entries, but not focused on performance counters.
     Metric Signal Type: Measures performance data over time, ideal for tracking performance counters and enabling alerts based on thresholds.
     Audit Log Signal Type: Tracks changes to resources for compliance and governance, but not intended for performance metrics.

     Signal Type	   Scenario	                                           Key Difference	Performance Monitoring
     Activity Log	   Track resource creation/deletion in Azure.	       Focuses on resource management events, not application performance.	Not for performance metrics.
     Application Log   Monitor specific application errors or events.	   Captures logs generated by applications, not focused on performance.	Not for performance counters.
     Metric	           Monitor CPU usage of a virtual machine over time.   Measures performance data (e.g., CPU, memory) and allows threshold-based alerts.	Ideal for performance monitoring.
     Audit Log	       Track    resource access or changes for governance.	 Tracks changes for compliance and auditing, not for performance.	Not for performance metrics.


 9. You need to update the definitions for an existing Logic App. what should be used
    logic app designer
  -- goto azure  portal --> logic app --> development tools --> code View editor opens and shows your logic app definition in JSON format.

 10. API back end is hosted in an Azure App Service instance. You have implemented a RESTful service for the API back end.
     You must configure back-end authentication for the API Management service instance.
     Apim secures ur backend using client certificates
     using client certificates to secure the API backends

 11. You create the index in Azure Search. You now need to use the Azure Search .NET SDK to import the relevant data into the Azure Search service.
    what 3 steps are needed to be taken

     1. create an index search client  Create a Search Index Client:
     var serviceClient = new SearchServiceClient("YourSearchServiceName", new SearchCredentials("YourAdminKey"));
     var indexClient = serviceClient.Indexes.GetClient("YourIndexName");
     2. Create the indexBatch with the documents Create Documents
     var documents = new List<Document>
     3. opulate the newly-created index  Upload Documents to Azure Search:
      IndexBatch.Upload(documents);


13. Containers in the same group share the same lifecycle, resources, network, and volumes.
 Azure Container Group, part of Azure Container Instances

 eg - If you deploy a web app and a logging service in the same container group,
 they can communicate through localhost and share storage volumes for logging purposes,
 and they will be managed as a single unit in terms of lifecycle.
