A global corporation that has recently acquired a smaller company.
The smaller company's employees need to access specific Azure resources within the parent corporation's Azure subscription.
these users have not yet been onboarded into the parent company's primary Microsoft Entra tenant.
 To avoid any operational disruptions, you have been tasked with ensuring these users get seamless
 access without compromising security or creating additional Microsoft Entra tenants.

 Set up an access package in Microsoft Entitlement Management and provide the acquired company's users access to the necessary Azure resources.

 Microsoft Entitlement Management in Microsoft Entra provides fine-grained access management for internal and external users.
 By setting up an access package, organizations can define a set of Azure resources, and users can request access to them
 The process can include approval workflows, and the access can be time-limited, ensuring that users only have access for as long as they need it

  Microsoft Entra External Identities is a feature that allows organizations to invite users
  from outside their tenant (like partners or collaborators) into their Microsoft Entra as guest users.
   While this can be a solution, it might not provide the granular control and governance that comes with Microsoft Entitlement Management,

 Managed identities are typically used for service-to-service authentication, not user authentication.
  They are suitable for Azure services to communicate with other services securely without managing credentials.

  Azure AD B2C (Business to Consumer) is primarily designed for customer-facing applications
  where you have external users signing in to use the services. It is not tailored for inter-company collaboration or resources sharing.

  example
  Imagine you are building an e-commerce website where customers can sign up,
  browse products, and make purchases.
  You want to allow users to sign in using their existing social media accounts (like Google, Facebook, or Microsoft accounts)
  or create a new account specifically for your website.

  Customer Sign-In: Azure AD B2C is used to manage the authentication and user profiles for all customers who sign up on your e-commerce platform.
  External Users: These customers are external users (not employees of your company)
                 who interact with your application to access services like browsing products, making purchases, and managing their orders.


  Azure AD B2B is used
  where employees or partners from different organizations need to collaborate or access shared resources (for that, Azure AD or Azure AD B2B is used).
  Imagine two companies, Company A and Company B, need to collaborate on a project.
   Company A uses Microsoft 365 for document management, email, and other services,
   and they want to give specific employees from Company B access to a shared SharePoint site where both companies can work together.


   Azure B2B: Focuses on inter-company collaboration.
   Azure B2C: Focuses on customer-facing applications.
   Microsoft Entra External Identities: Unifies external identity management for both B2B and B2C.
   Managed Identities: Provides secure identity management for Azure services without user intervention.
   Microsoft Entitlement Management: Automates and governs access to resources, especially useful in large organizations.
