ec2 instance - elastic cloud compoute
advance setting {use data } --need to run only once on server startup
in the summary we can all details --no of instances ,os,type of virtual server,storage volumes ebs
,once launched we can see odr details

Types of instances -- based on  ram high speed ,performance
https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/

Aws naming convention

General Purpose , Compute Optimized, MemoryOptimized
m5.2xlarge
m:instance class -- general pur
5:generation (keeps improvong)
2xlarge:size within the instance class

General Purpose -- for web servers and code repos
good balance with compute, memory , network
t2

Compute Optimized -- batch processing ,high perofromance web servers,machine learning
c6g

MemoryOptimized - R6g-- high ram

# Security Groups
they handle traffic coming in and out of our ec2 instancees
they are like firewall living outside the ec2 instance
These groups have rules
Type Protocol port range  source    description
http tcp      22          0.0.0.0/0 {anywhere}
ssh  tcp      80          128.91.146.85/32  -- specific

inbound and outbound rules
Network and Security GRoups -->


#ssh
secure shell -- allow u to control a remote machine

Use Ec2 instance connect
Use IamRole to connect to ur ec2 instane

Private vs Public Vs Elastic Ip
Elastic Ip is a fixed public ip for ur ec2 isntance,it is ipv4
Avoid using ElasticIp -- use load balancer or dns![](../../Screenshot 2023-07-11 at 17.08.56.png)
BY default ec2 comes with private ip for aws internals


Load BAlancers -- server balancing load
It is managed by aws -  cost less
high availability,handles failures,separates public traffic from private traffic
performs health checks

4 types of lOad Balancers
classic lb
application lb -http https websocket
network lb
gateway lb

users--- lb -- ec2
lb has security groups

Application Lb- layer 7
Choose an Application Load Balancer when you need a flexible feature set for your applications with HTTP and HTTPS traffic.
 Operating at the request level, Application Load Balancers provide advanced routing and visibility features targeted at
  application architectures, including microservices and containers.
Load balancing http request across machines
Routing based on url - great fit for microservices and containerbased applications

www ----route /users --->apploadbalancer--- targetGrp users for application{health groups}

www ----route /search --->apploadbalancer--- targetGrp search for application{health groups}

What are target groups
Ec2 can be managed by auto scaling groups (https)
managed by itself http
lamda functions
health groups are at target group levels
