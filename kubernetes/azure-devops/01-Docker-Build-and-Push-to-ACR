This sample we are going to create a local repository and create basic docker image and push the changes to github and then
From there we will run our azure pipeline --- azure pipline wil pull the code from git hub and push the docker image to azure container registry

1.Create a git hub repositiry
local git repo https://github.com/ronrash/az-kubernetes

2. create an azure container registry --> azrondevops.azurecr.io -- service name

Go to Services -> Container Registries
Click on Add
Subscription: Azure subscription 1
Resource Group: aks-rg1
Registry Name: azrondevops.azurecr.io (NAME should be unique across Azure Cloud)
Location: Central US
SKU: Basic (Pricing Note: $0.167 per day)
Click on Review + Create
Click on Create

Step 3 Create a devops Organization

https://dev.azure.com/rohitprashar712/
Sign in to Azure DevOps
Our Organization will be automatically created and if you want to manually create organization you can create one.
Organization Name: rohitprashar712

Step 4 create a devops project
Project Name: azure-demo-210191
Project Description:
Visibility: Private
Advanced: Leave to defaults
Version Control: Git
Work Item Process: Basic

Step 5  Create Basic Build Pipeline

Create Folder -> App1-Pipelines
Go to Pipelines -> Create New Pipeline
Where is your Code?: Github
Select Repository:
Provide Github Password
Click on Approve and Install for Repositories selected
Configure Your Pipeline: Docker (Build and Push Image to Azure Container Registry )
Select an Azure Subscription: activesubsciption1
Continue (Login as admin user)
Container Registry: azrondevops
Image Name: app-demo-nginx
Dockerfile: $(Build.SourcesDirectory)/Dockerfile
Click on Validate and Configure
Change Pipeline Name: 01-docker-build-and-push-to-acr-pipeline.yml
Click on Save and Run
Commit Message: Pipeline-1: Docker Build and Push to ACR
Commit directly to master branch: check
Click on Save and Run

Step 6 -- makes some changes anad push again it will retrigger the build
Step 7 --> check ur acr under repositories it will push the images
 -- so under ur repos -- u can have a folder like structure and push all the imgaes
   - appdemonginx -- this our repo name

docker pull azrondevops.azurecr.io/appdemonginx:4
so here in acr maintain a folder like sturcture
-- app1Nginx -- these are tags for the same image
   - 1
   - 2
-- app2Java
   - 1
   - 2
   - 3
-- app3Python
   - 1
   - 2
   - 3
 Add Namespace for Docker Images stored in ACR
 Go to Pipeline -> 01-Docker-Build-and-Push-to-ACR -> Edit
 Update the below and Save
 # Before
   imageRepository: 'app1nginx'

 # After
   imageRepository: 'app1/app1nginx' -- inside my acr we will have app1--> under that we will have all the repos

doing this change will retrigger a pipeline build

Disable the pipeline
Go to Pipeline -> 01-Docker-Build-and-Push-to-ACR -> Settings -> Disable
