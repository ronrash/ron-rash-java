Iaas Infrastructuire as a service
Infrastructure as code (IaC) is the process of managing and provisioning infrastructure
(networks, virtual machines, load balancers, and connection topology) through CODE/Config Files.
E:g
Vagrant for local
Terraform for Cloud
Ansible for Servers

Cloudformation for AWS
Use Only Infrastructure from cloud like using vm virtual machine services to deploy ur app/databases
Cloud Provider is responsible for Hardware,Netwroking and Virtualization
Lets say u want to deploy a java application on a linux instance
u are responsible for installing Linux then jvm and then the application
You are responsible for Os upgrades and patches
Application Code and Runtime
Configuring Load Balances managing between these vms
Auto Scaling -- limke redcuing nu of vms
Availabilty -- making sure vm are avaiable

These all are done using terraform
The Cloud Provide is responsible for the hardware and virtualization software after that it is all ur responsibilty
like upgrades scaling load balancing

Alternative to This PAAS -platform as a service -- give the above responsibilty to cloud provider
If u have a java app just give ur code ,, cloud provider is responsible for os and jvm,,
u are responsible for the code of ur application

In Paas
Cloud Provide is responsible for Iaas + Os upgrades  patches application runtimes (ie auto scaling availability load balancing )
Elastic Beanstalk  Azure App Service Google app engine
Database  Relational & No Sql (Azure Sql Amazon RDS)
Ai Queues Ml Operations

 Docker Images of the Microservice --- Docker Image has everything a microserice needs
 like app runtime jdk  code dependencies
 Docker is cloud neutral light wieght and they do not have a guest OS and also provides isolation for containers
 Amazon eks
 Amzon ecs -- cloud container service in aws
 Fargate -- Serverless ECS/EKS


 Serverless -- u dont need to worry about ur clusters like if u have 2 instances-- what is the hardware/sofware/os of these instances
