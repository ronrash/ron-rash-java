When configuring Azure API Management, what are two specific benefits of authorization code OAuth grants?

The method of transmitting requests between a browser, client, authorization server, and resource server
allows the client to submit credentials to a trusted third party rather than the specific application handling the authorization request.
It also avoids transmitting the access token through the client browser, which limits the potential risk of the client's
token being stolen/copied by a malicious user.
