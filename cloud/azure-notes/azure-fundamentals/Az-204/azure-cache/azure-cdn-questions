What does purging NOT affect in a CDN?
Local browser caches.

In Azure CDN, purging a file removes it from the cache, allowing updated caching rules to be applied.
Deleting refers to removing the file from the origin server, not the cache, and won't reset the cache duration.

The number of CDN profiles that can be created is limited by the type of Azure subscription.
