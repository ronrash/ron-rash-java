Azure Monitor can ingest data from a large number of applications and services in your cloud and on-premises infrastructure.
You can use azure monitor to do analytics,logs alerts

In this lab, you'll learn more about Azure Monitor by configuring metrics,
saving visualized data in dashboards, setting alerts, and automating responses to your data with action groups.

Configure and save metrics in Azure Monitor
Metrics are an Azure Monitor tool provides near-real-time numerical data about ur infrastructure.
Metrics are collected at regular, defined intervals and help you act on data quickly,
 both by visualizing data and helping automate actions based on that data through alerts.


 Goto Monitor --> metrics-->{select the vm u have created eg ca-lab-vm}
 Now lets create some metrics

 Select Percentage CPU as the Metric and Avg as the Aggregation:
 The Metric drop-down allows you to select different metrics to track.
 The Aggregation drop-down allows you to specify different options for processing the the data points.

Log Analytics workspaces are unique environments to collect and interact with several Azure Monitor data sources in Azure.
Companies use Log Analytics workspaces in part because it allows them to import data from a variety of sources
and query it using a robust query language that you'll cover in another lab step.

You can also manage alerts, view the health of your resources and more from your workspace.
In this lab step, you'll practice creating a Log Analytics workspace and configuring it to receive log data from an Azure VM.

Steps
Goto LogAnaytics Workspaces
create
give details
Subscription: Leave as the default option
Resource Group: Select the only available one
Name: ca-lab-workspaceXXXX, where XXXX is a random 4-digit number
Region: West US

review and create
 You've created a Log Analytics workspace. Next, you'll need to import data from some source,
 to be able to view that data in your new workspace. An Azure virtual machine has been provisioned in this lab.
 You'll connect that VM to your workspace next, so that you can view its data.

gotot log anaytics workspace
--> under classic --select virtual machine .. se ur vm and click connect to connect to this workspace

============================== ==========================================================================================
A big reason companies use Log Analytics workspaces is their ability to use a
powerful query language called Kusto Query Language (KQL) to query logs.
KQL is a pipeline-driven, read-only query language that will look very familiar if you've ever worked with a structured query language (SQL).

In this lab step, you'll use KQL to query data about the virtual machine you connected to your Log Analytics workspace.

Steps
In your workspace blade, click Logs on the left under General:
 Input the Heartbeat command into the query window:
 The Heartbeat query checks virtual machines attached to a workspace at regular intervals

Metric alerts are an Azure Monitor tool used to alert you when some metric crosses a threshold,
 Metric alerts can be triggered by a wide range of both pre-defined and custom metrics,
 and can be used to do anything from send an email or text to triggering an Azure function.

In this lab step, you'll configure a metric alert to fire when an Azure VM has used more than a specified amount of CPU, on average, over a certain period.

goto monitor--> alert rule -slect vm--> next conditions select percentage cpu
conditions
signal name --> percentage cpu
aggregation type --> Avergae
operator --> greater than
Threshold value --> 80

when to evaluate
check every 1 min
lookback 5 min

This means that your alarm will trigger if its CPU usage average goes over 0, for a period of at least 1 minute.
