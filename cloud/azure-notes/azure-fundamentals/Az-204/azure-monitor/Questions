Application Insights can collect data from applications in Azure,
 running on-premise, or on other clouds.
 The integration with Azure Web Apps makes it exceptionally easy to use in Azure.


 Question
  You need to find an effective monitoring solution to do the following:
  Monitor performance of Azure Service Environment 1 and the on-premise database servers.
  Provide alerts when communication between the on-premise database and Azure Service Environment 1 is disrupted.
  Provide quantitative data regarding customer usage.


The telemetry data in Application Insights, you notice that during these peak times,
the server response time occasionally spikes beyond acceptable limits.
You decide to proactively address this by setting up an automated alert to
notify the operations team whenever the server response time crosses a certain threshold during peak hours.

Answer
Set up a log search alert that triggers when the average server response time in the last 15 minutes during peak hours exceeds the defined threshold.

log search alerts. They can be set up based on custom metrics, including response times.
 By creating a log search alert, you can precisely specify criteria like "average response time over the last 15 minutes"
  and further filter the data for peak hours, making this a suitable solution for the scenario described.

The remaining choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

URL Ping Tests monitor the availability of endpoints, but not specifically the average response time.
 While they can provide some insights into the response times, they are designed primarily to check availability.
Multi-step web  tests are designed to monitor multi-page navigation processes.
 They're more suited for monitoring processes like sign-up forms or shopping carts, and not specifically for average server response times.
While custom telemetry processors can be used to filter or process telemetry data,
setting up a custom processor for this specific task is overcomplicating the process.
Using built-in metrics and alerting features is more straightforward and effective.
