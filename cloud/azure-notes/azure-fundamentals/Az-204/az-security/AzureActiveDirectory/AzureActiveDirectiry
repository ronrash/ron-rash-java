For example, what if you wanted to assign permission to view Storage containers but not to read the blobs inside those containers?
Create custom role that contained only that permission. You need to have  permission to create custom roles first.

Microsoft Entra ID can only authenticate users.
RBAC rol ased access is  what they should be allowed to do in Azure


Contributors -- should be assigned to developer -- Developers need to be able to access and modify everything
Readder role to End-users need access to everything, but they shouldn’t have the ability to modify anything
Administrators need to be able to access and modify everything, and they also need to be able to grant or deny access to other users.


When using RBAC, you assign roles to users and groups, and also  assign them to Azure service instances
A typical example would be: you have an application that runs on a virtual machine that needs to
read data from and write data to an Azure SQL Database instance called SQL Database
1. So the application would need to be granted the permissions to do that.
However, you wouldn’t be able to grant permissions to the application itself,
but you could grant them to the virtual machine instance on which the application is running.
You could assign the SQL DB Contributor role for SQL Database 1 to the virtual machine.
