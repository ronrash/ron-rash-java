Create a group on whichc to apply mfa

LOgin in azure portal as admin --> active directory --> conditional access
create a new policy --> {mfa deployment policy }--> select the user grps radio button --> done

Under clouds apps --> select apps -> microsoft azure management
here we are enforcing mfa wherenvere somenone logins in the azure portal

make sure under grants {allow access control }--> grant access is selected --check mfa box --> enable policy --> policy created

Now we can login into any other microsfts resource without mfa ,
 but if we login into the azure portal mfa will be required

Manage User settings

 As an admin we can enforce all users to complet the mfa process ie
   re-provide contact methods
   delete app passwords
   Require mfa on all trusted devices

 ========= ========= ========= ========= ========= ========= ========= ========= =========
Perform  User settings in MFa

Setup a user to our  account to use mFA -- see above details
Now the user has mfa but we will setup so that he has to  re-provide contact methods

go to azure active dir--> users--> on right pane in mfa clikc mfa {opens up a new page}
--> sleet the user --manage his settings --> check the options  re-provide contact methods

so next time when the user logins he will require extra steps along with mfa
