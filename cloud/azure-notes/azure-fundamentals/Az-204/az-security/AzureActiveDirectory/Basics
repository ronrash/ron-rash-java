What is an Azure AD Tenant?
Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Tenant is a dedicated and trusted instance of Azure AD that an
 organization receives when it creates a relationship with Microsoft.
  It is a directory service designed to handle identity and access management for users, applications, and other resources.
  
Imagine a company named "ABC-CORP Ltd." When ABC-CORP decides to use Azure services,
 they create an Azure AD tenant specifically for their organization. This tenant includes:

User Accounts: All the employees of ABC-CORP are added to this tenant, each with their unique user accounts.
Groups: ABC-CORP creates groups (e.g., HR, IT, Sales) within the tenant to manage permissions and access to different resources.
Applications: ABC-CORP registers its internal applications in this tenant so that employees can sign in using their corporate credentials.
Access Control: Policies are defined to control who can access which resources and under what conditions
 (e.g., multi-factor authentication requirements).  
 
 
How It Works
User Sign-In: When an employee of ABC-CORP logs into an Azure service, Azure AD authenticates the user against the ABC-CORP AD tenant.
Resource Access: If the user tries to access a resource (e.g., a web app registered in the Azure AD tenant),
Azure AD verifies if the user has the necessary permissions and grants access accordingly.
Application Integration: If ABC-CORP uses third-party applications, they can be integrated with Azure AD for single sign-on (SSO),
 providing a seamless login experience.
