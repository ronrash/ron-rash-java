u need to generate a shared access signature token that grants the Read permission to a blob container.

BlobSasBuilder sasBuilder = new BlobSasBuilder()
 { BlobContainerName = containerClient.Name, Resource = "c" };
 sasBuilder.ExpiresOn = DateTimeOffset.UtcNow.AddHours(1); sasBuilder.SetPermissions(BlobContainerSasPermissions.Read);
 Uri sasUri = containerClient.GenerateSasUri(sasBuilder);


 The code segment that includes Resource = "c" and sasBuilder.SetPermissions(BlobContainerSasPermissions.Read);
  will generate the shared access signatures token that grants the Read permission to a blob container.

 The code segment that includes resource = ‘b’ will generate a shared access signatures token at the blob level.

 The code segments that include sasBuilder.SetPermissions(BlobContainerSasPermissions.Create);
 will generate a shared access signatures token with the Create permission at the blob level.


2. create a managed identity for an Azure virtual machine
user account must have sufficient permissions to create the managed identity.
principle of least privilege must be used

Virtual Machine Contributor is the least privileged built-in role required to create a managed identity for an Azure VM.
 Virtual Machine Administrator Login is not sufficient to create a managed identity for an Azure VM.
 Global Administrator and Security Administrator have excessive permissions to Microsoft Entra ID,
 which does not follow the principle of least privilege.
 Global Administrator and Security Administrator do not provide sufficient permissions to the Azure resources.


3, To use the custom key stored in KeyVault1,
the identity assigned to AppConfig1 needs to have GET, WRAP, and UNWRAP permissions to the custom key.
The DECRYPT and ENCRYPT permissions are not required to use the custom key stored in KeyVault1 in this scenario.

There are two common ways to deploy a multi-container group: use an Azure Resource Manager template or a YAML file.
An Azure Resource Manager template is recommended when you need to deploy additional
Azure service resources (for example, an Azure Files share) when you deploy the container instances.
However, a YAML file does not support the deployment of additional Azure service resources along with container groups in ACI.
Docker Compose and Azure CLI do not support the deployment of an Azure Files share along with a container group to ACI.
