 Managed identities eliminate the need for developers to manage the credentials stored in azure key vault
 Applications can use managed identities to obtain Microsoft Entra tokens without having to manage any credentials.
for example i want to build and app using azure app services that access azure storage without having to manage any credentials

Types of managed identities
System assigned-- tied to the resource,lifecycle depends upon the the resource ,if the resource is deleted the identity is deleted

USer-assigned- not tied to the resource ,separatley managed , can be assigned to multiple resources.

Internally, managed identities are service principals of a special type, which are locked to only be used with Azure resources.
When the managed identity is deleted, the corresponding service principal is automatically removed.

Characteristics of managed identities

Characteristic	 System-assigned managed identity	                                                      User-assigned managed identity
Creation	    Created as part of an Azure resource                                                        Created as a stand-alone Azure resource
              (  for example, an Azure virtual machine or Azure App Service)
Lifecycle	    Shared lifecycle with the Azure resource that the managed identity is created with.           Independent life-cycle. Must be explicitly deleted.
               When the parent resource is deleted, the managed identity is deleted as well.
Sharing across Azure resources	Can't be shared, it can only be associated with a single Azure resource.	Can be shared, the same user-assigned managed identity can be associated with more than one Azure resource.

When to use managed identities ?

Use managed identities if you want to build an app using Azure App Services
that accesses Azure Storage without having to manage any credentials.
or

build an app using azure vms,app service,kubernets,container,storage connecting to storage another app,azure resource,apim etc
 how your app uses managed identities with Azure Key Vault and Azure Storage:

1.Create the Managed Identity:

  When you enable managed identity for your Azure App Service,
  Azure gives it a unique identity. Think of it as a special account that your app can use to access other services.

  you give this identity permission to access Azure Key Vault and Azure Storage. For example:
  In Azure Key Vault, you allow the identity to read secrets (like connection strings for your storage account).
  In Azure Storage, you allow the identity to access data (e.g., read/write files).

2. Store Secrets in Azure Key Vault:

3. App Uses Managed Identity to Access Key Vault:
when your app runs, it uses its managed identity to authenticate with Azure Key Vault.
The app asks Azure Key Vault for the secret (e.g., the connection string for Azure Storage).
Azure Key Vault checks if the appâ€™s managed identity has the right permissions to access the secret. If it does, it gives the secret back to the app.

code

public class App {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Set up the SecretClient using managed identity (DefaultAzureCredential)
        SecretClient secretClient = new SecretClientBuilder()
            .vaultUrl("https://<your-key-vault-name>.vault.azure.net")
            .credential(new DefaultAzureCredentialBuilder().build())
            .buildClient();

        // Retrieve the storage account connection string from Key Vault
        String storageConnectionString = secretClient.getSecret("StorageConnectionString").getValue();

        // Now, use the storageConnectionString to access your Azure Storage
        System.out.println("Storage Connection String: " + storageConnectionString);
        // You can use the connection string here to interact with Azure Storage (e.g., upload/download files)
    }
}
DefaultAzureCredential: This automatically uses the managed identity of the app when it's deployed in Azure App Service.
SecretClient: Connects to Azure Key Vault using the managed identity to retrieve the secret (StorageConnectionString).
Storage Access: You can use the connection string obtained from Key Vault to interact with Azure Storage securely.

How a system-assigned managed identity works with an Azure virtual machine

====================================================================================================
To create, or enable, an Azure virtual machine with the system-assigned managed identity
 your account needs the Virtual Machine Contributor role assignment

Enable system-assigned managed identity during creation of an Azure virtual machine

az vm create --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --name myVM --image win2016datacenter \
    --generate-ssh-keys \
    --assign-identity \  system assigned identity
    --role contributor \  role is contributor
    --scope mySubscription \  subscription name
    --admin-username azureuser \
    --admin-password myPassword12

Enable system-assigned managed identity on an existing Azure virtual machine
az vm identity assign -g myResourceGroup -n myVm

========================================================================================================================================================================================================

User Assigned Identity
Create the user-assigned identity
Assign the identity to a virtual machine

your account needs the
Virtual Machine Contributor and
Managed Identity Operator role assignments

Create a user-assigned identity
az identity create -g <resource-group-name> -n myUserAssignedIdentity --> <user-assigned identity name>

Assign a user-assigned managed identity during the creation of an Azure virtual machine
az vm create \
--resource-group <RESOURCE GROUP> \
--name <VM NAME> \
--image Ubuntu2204 \
--admin-username <USER NAME> \
--admin-password <PASSWORD> \
--assign-identity <USER ASSIGNED IDENTITY NAME> \
--role <ROLE> \
--scope <SUBSCRIPTION>

Assign a user-assigned managed identity to an existing Azure virtual machine

az vm identity assign \
    -g <RESOURCE GROUP> \
    -n <VM NAME> \
    --identities <USER ASSIGNED IDENTITY>

# Set the VM name and resource group
$vmName = "YourVMName"
$resourceGroup = "YourResourceGroupName"

# Enable system-assigned managed identity on the VM
Set-AzVM -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup -Name $vmName -IdentityType SystemAssigned

Acquire an access token
The default method is  DefaultAzureCredential.
Azure Identity library supports a DefaultAzureCredential type
DefaultAzureCredential is intended to simplify getting started with the SDK


// When deployed to an azure host, the default azure credential will authenticate the specified user assigned managed identity.

String managedIdentityClientId = "<your managed identity client Id>"; // Replace with your actual client ID

        // Create a credential using the DefaultAzureCredentialBuilder and specify the client ID for the user-assigned managed identity
        DefaultAzureCredential credential = new DefaultAzureCredentialBuilder()
            .managedIdentityClientId(managedIdentityClientId)
            .build();

        // Create a BlobClient to interact with a blob
        BlobClient blobClient = new BlobClientBuilder()
            .endpoint("https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/myblob") // Replace with your actual endpoint
            .credential(credential)
            .buildClient();
