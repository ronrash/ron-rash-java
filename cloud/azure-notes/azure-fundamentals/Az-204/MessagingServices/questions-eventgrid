1.You are developing an application that uses Azure Blob storage.
The application must read the transaction logs of all the changes that occur to the blobs
and the blob metadata in the storage account for auditing purposes. The changes must be in the order in which they
occurred, include only create, update, delete, and copy operations and be retained for compliance reasons.
You need to process the transaction logs asynchronously.
What should you do?
• A. Process all Azure Blob storage events by using Azure Event Grid with a subscriber Azure Function app.
• B. Enable the change feed on the storage account and process all changes for available events.
• C. Process all Azure Storage Analytics logs for successful blob events.
• D. Use the Azure Monitor HTTP Data Collector API and scan the request body for successful blob
events.
Answer: B

2.You develop an app that allows users to upload photos and videos to Azure storage. The app uses a storage REST API call to upload the media to a blob storage account named Account1. You have blob storage containers named Container1 and Container2.
  Uploading of videos occurs on an irregular basis.
  You need to copy specific blobs from Container1 to Container2 when a new video is uploaded.
  What should you do?
  • A. Copy blobs to Container2 by using the Put Blob operation of the Blob Service REST API
  • B. Create an Event Grid topic that uses the Start-AzureStorageBlobCopy cmdlet
  • C. Use AzCopy with the Snapshot switch to copy blobs to Container2
  • D. Download the blob to a virtual machine and then upload the blob to Container2
  B event grid will monitor for specific vents and Start-AzureStorageBlobCopy will start copying data
