In this lab, you will use the Azure Portal to create a Namespace
, and you will use Azure CloudShell to create a Topic and Subscription inside your Azure Service Bus namespace.

1. enter Service Bus

2. To begin creating a namespace, in the top-left, click + Create:
3. Under PROJECT DETAILS, select the following:

Give the details for rg,subsciprion

Namespace name: calabs-sb- (Replace XXXX with some random characters)
Location: Select West US
Pricing tier: Select Standard

Basic: Allows you to use Queues, but not Topics.
Standard: In addition to Topics, you can make use of message Deduplication and Sessions.
Premium: Similar to Standard, but includes Availability Zone support, Resource Isolation, and larger maximum message size of 1MB.

A namespace in Azure Service Bus is a container for messaging components. A namespace can contain multiple Queues or Topics.



============Use Azure cloud shell ======
for that u need a storage-->
10. To configure the storage for Azure Cloud Shell, click Show advanced settings:
 set the properties


Use the command below to find your resource group name:
az group list --query '[0].name' --output tsv
o/p - cal-3760-e32

To list Azure Service Bus namespaces, enter the following in the command prompt:
az servicebus namespace list -g $(az group list --query '[0].name' --output tsv)

You will see a JSON response showing details of the namespace you created with the Azure Portal.

. To retrieve just the name of the namespace, enter the following:
az servicebus namespace list --query '[0].name' -g $(az group list --query '[0].name' --output tsv)

To create a Topic in Azure Service Bus, enter the following command:
az servicebus topic create \
  -g $(az group list --query '[0].name' --output tsv) \
  --namespace-name $(az servicebus namespace list --query '[0].name' --output tsv -g $(az group list --query '[0].name' --output tsv)) \
  --name lab-topic

In response to issuing this command, you will see a JSON representation of a newly created Topic named lab-topic.

A Topic in Azure Service Bus enables one-to-many communication.
In contrast to Queues, which only allow processing by a single consumer.

In this command, the name of the resource group and the namespace are fetched in subshells.
 Notice that you have specified the --output option to be tab-separated values (tsv).
 The default output is JSON, which would quote the string and cause errors.

17. Enter the following command to see how to create a subscription:
az servicebus topic subscription --help
You will see listed the available commands for managing Azure Service Bus Subscriptions with the Azure command-line interface.

In Azure Service Bus, consumers receive messages from Subscriptions to Topics, not directly from a Topic.
Note that a Subscription in Azure Service Bus is not the same as a Subscription in Azure generally.

18. To create a Subscription to your Topic, enter the following command:
RESOURCE_GROUP=$(az group list --query '[0].name' --output tsv)
NAMESPACE_NAME=$(az servicebus namespace list --query '[0].name' --output tsv -g $(az group list --query '[0].name' --output tsv))
TOPIC_NAME=$(az servicebus topic list --namespace-name $NAMESPACE_NAME --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --query '[0].name' --output tsv)
az servicebus topic subscription create \
  --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
  --namespace-name $NAMESPACE_NAME \
  --topic-name $TOPIC_NAME \
  --name lab-subscription

Similarly to when you created the Topic, you will see a JSON representation of your newly created Subscription in response.

This command is making use of variables in Bash.
The resource group, namespace name, and topic name are fetched and stored in variables prior to creating the Subscription.
 This has two benefits, it makes the command easier to read,
 and it means that the resource group and namespace name are only fetched once, making the command faster to execute.

Next, you will view your Topic and Subscription in the Azure Portal.


n the left-hand menu, under Entities, click Topics:
You will see the topic you created with the Azure command-line interface listed.

. To see details about your topic, click lab-topic:

22. Scroll to the bottom of the page, and under Subscriptions, click lab-subscription:
