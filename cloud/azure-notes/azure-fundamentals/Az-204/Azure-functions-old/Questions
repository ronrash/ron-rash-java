You have an App Service plan named asp1 based on the Free pricing tier.
You plan to use asp1 to implement an Azure Function app with a queue trigger. Your solution must minimize cost.
You need to identify the configuration options that will meet the requirement

Always on and basci tier -- Free and Shared tiers do not support "Always On," but the basic one does

2. A company requires a function that can process incoming files automatically.
They upload images regularly into a storage service, and they want those images to be resized automatically.
 Which Azure service could you use to trigger this function? Fill in the triggers and bindings in the following code:

This scenario is perfect for a Blob Storage trigger. The function could be triggered whenever a new blob (image) is added to the Blob Storage.
Inside the function, you could use an image processing library to resize the images.

[FunctionName("ResizeImage")]
public static void Run(
    [BlobTrigger("<container-name>/{name}", Connection = "BlobStorageConnectionString")]
    Stream inputImage,

    [Blob("<container-name>/{name}", FileAccess.Write, Connection = "BlobStorageConnectionString")]
    Stream outputImage,

    string name,
    ILogger log)
{
    // Read the input image
    // Resize the image
    // Write the resized image to output image
}

3.You are tasked with developing an Azure Function that will be triggered by Azure Blob storage.
The function should only be triggered when .jpg files are added to a container named images.
Which of the following filter criteria for path in the function.json file would meet the requirement?

images/{name}.jpg

4. You've been assigned a project where your task is to design an Azure function that activates automatically every 10 minutes.
 This function has to interact with a vast amount of unstructured data such as text or binary data from a source,
 perform necessary computations, and subsequently modify another source with the outcome.

 trigger - timer trigger
 input bunding -- blob bcoz there is  unstructured data such as text or binary data
 output binding -- blob bcoz there is  unstructured data such as text or binary data

cron expression {seconds}{min}{hour}{day}{month}{dayofweek}
 [functionName("ProcessData")]
 public static void run(
 [TimerTrigger(0 */10 * * * * )] TimerInfo myTimer,

// input binding
 [Blob("<container-name>/<blob-name>",FileAccess.Read, Connection = "" )] Stream inputData,
 // output binding
 [Blob("<container-name>/<blob-name>",FileAccess.Write, Connection = "" )] Stream outputData,

 ){
     // Read data from input
     // Process the data
     // Write the processed data to output


 }
