Azure functions,, run code on cloud,
every fa has a storage account, if the storage account is deleted the fa is deleted
they are just http endpoints that u can call any other hhtp endpoint
they reside on azure any time u call on demand.
less costly
storage types -->
blob storage,Azure files by default,
queue storage
table storage


Azure function have triggers,binding,they are serverless and no host server to hold or store info between calls.
they are provisoned in the cloud and deprov when not in use

-------------

the trigger type  u choose actuall defines ur project
a specific type of event which causes the function to run

types of trigger
Http/webhook -- when httop or webhook hits the endpoint the trigger causes the fucntion to execute/run
eg-- github repo,delete,download,push pull req,commit fork
timer-- based on some time
storage queue -- some message comes in the queue triggering our function, message contents are passed as input to the function
service bus queue or topic
blob trigger --
event hub -- when events reach the hub
data

only one trigger
all bindings in/out and triggers have a direction prpoperty
trigger dir is always in

Anatomy
