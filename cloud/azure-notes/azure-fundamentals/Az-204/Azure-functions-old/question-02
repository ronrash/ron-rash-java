1. Where would you specify the logging settings for these Azure Functions?
The logging configurations for Azure Functions are set in the host.json file

2.Write a cron  30th minute of every two hours, for the first 15 days of the summer months (June, July, and August),
on weekdays (Monday through Friday).
{seconds}{min}{hour}{day}{month}{dayofweek}
0 30 */2 1-15 6-8 1-5

3.which http method to get a function key? Post and to create OUt
https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}
/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/{name}/{scope}/{host-or-function-name}/listkeys?api-version=2022-03-01

4.Which triggers in Azure Functions are supported on Consumption plan:

Table storage and Notification Hubs are not valid triggers. RabbitMQ and Kafka are not supported on Consumption plan.
Table storage, Mobile Apps, Notification Hubs, SendGrid, and Twilio are not valid triggers.

5. Which of the following can be input binding in an Azure Function:
You can only read from objects that store data, not queues
blob storage ,cosmos db ,mobile apps ,signalr table

not Event Grid,Event Hubs,HTTP & webhooks,IoT Hub

6 sample inout and output binding
Blob("samples-workitems/{queueTrigger}", FileAccess.Read) is an input binding (Read)
Blob("samples-workitems/{queueTrigger}", FileAccess.Write) is an output binding (Write)

7.Suppose you're working for an e-commerce company that has high traffic and they're dealing with large amounts of customer orders.
 The company wants to keep a track of every order received in real-time and then send an automated confirmation email to the customer.
  Which Azure service would you choose to trigger your Azure function? Fill in the triggers and bindings in the following code:
  the Azure function could be triggered by the Service Bus where each order corresponds to a message in a Service Bus Queue or Topic.
  The function could then use the SendGrid output binding to send a confirmation email to the customer.

   [ServiceBusTrigger("<queue-name>", Connection = "ServiceBusConnectionString")]
      Order order,

      [SendGrid(ApiKey = "SendGridApiKey")]
      out SendGridMessage message,

output binding in an Azure Function:
event grid ,Event Hubs,HTTP & webhooks
Mobile Apps,Notification Hubs,Queue storage

except Timer and IoT Hub.

8.The requirement is to have a custom handler web server that starts up in less than 60 seconds.
Go HTTP server with a startup time of 50 seconds
Ruby on Rails server with a startup time of 55 seconds

9. configure custom handler
Modify host.json to include the customHandler property with the executable path and arguments.
Set "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "custom" in local.settings.json.

10. createa  consumption plan
// create a group and then a storage account and then a function app
az group create --name grp1 --location eastus
az storage account create --name $storageName --location $location --resource-group $resourceGroupName --sku Standard_LRS
az functionapp create --resource-group $resourceGroupName --consumption-plan-location
$location --runtime node --functions-version 3 --name $functionAppName --storage-account $storageName


11.Which of the following Azure Functions hosting plans is best when predictive scaling and costs are required?
Dedicated Plan

HTTP triggers get new instances at most every second. Non-HTTP triggers get them at most every 30 seconds.
