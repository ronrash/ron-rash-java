How to deploy Azure functions??
1.We can deploy directly from our visual studio code -- for this we need azure function extensions
2. directly into a local git -- Inside function app we need to configure with git
3. recommended way is using a  source control integration with remote git repositories hosted
on services like GitHub, Bitbucket or Azure Repos.This offers the continuous deployment.
source control integration enables a workflow in which a code update triggers deployment to function
so when we push a code to a git repo azure functions are compiled and automaticlly deployed to


Monitor Azure Functions
Monitor ur azure function app by integrating it with Application Insights Service.
Azure functions needs storage account to store the function app code and functions runtime data
It store the logs in storage account

Monitor ur Azure function app by creating alerts for eg
For example, you can choose from about 64 signals to alert on.
Say, for example, I could alert on client Http errors.
So if I'm getting more than ten errors, say over a five minute period, then it should trigger an alert.
Once you have set 1 or 2 conditions, you can describe the alert details which will be displayed in
the table on alerts page.
