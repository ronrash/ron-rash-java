# First Stage: Build Stage
# Use .NET Core SDK image to build the application
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/sdk:3.0 AS build

# Set the working directory to /app for the build process
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the solution file to the container
COPY *.sln .            # Copy solution file to the /app directory

# Copy the project file(s) into a 'checkout' folder in the container
COPY checkout/*.csproj ./checkout/  # Copy project file to /app/checkout

# Restore all dependencies defined in the .csproj file
RUN dotnet restore       # Run dotnet restore to download dependencies

# Copy the remaining application source code files
COPY checkout/. ./checkout/  # Copy all files from local checkout/ to container's /app/checkout

# Publish the application in Release mode to the 'out' directory
RUN dotnet publish -c Release -o out   # Compile and publish to /app/checkout/out

# Second Stage: Runtime Stage
# Use a lighter ASP.NET Core runtime image to run the application
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/aspnet:3.0 AS runtime

# Set the working directory for the runtime stage to /app
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the published application from the build stage to the runtime stage
COPY --from=build /app/checkout/out ./  # Copy built files from the build stage

# Set the entry point to run the application using the 'dotnet' command
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "checkout.dll"]   # Start the app by running checkout.dll
