Static website hosting is a feature that you have to enable on the storage account.

 blob storage container named $web is created by default
 files in this container are case-senstative and have only read access

 If the server returns a 404 error, and you haven't specified an error document
 when you enabled the website, then a default 404 page is returned to the user.

 Data is replicated to secondary regions asynchronously.

 Changing the anonymous access level of the $web container affects the primary blob service endpoint
 but does not impact the primary static website endpoint, which remains publicly accessible.

 You can configure a custom domain with a static website by using Azure Content Delivery Network (Azure CDN).
 Azure CDN provides consistent low latencies to your website from anywhere in the world.
 You can configure a custom SSL certificate with a static website by using Azure CDN
 You can configure the host header for a static website by using Azure CDN - Verizon Premium.

 Why am I getting an HTTP 404 error from a static website
 File names and extensions in the url of a static website are case-sensitive even though they're served over HTTP.
 Azure CDN endpoint isn't yet provisioned.
 Wait up to 90 minutes after you provision a new Azure CDN for the propagation to complete.
