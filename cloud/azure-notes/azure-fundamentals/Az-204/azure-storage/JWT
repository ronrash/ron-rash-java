Scenario Overview:
You're storing delivery driver profile information in Azure AD using an Azure Function that's called from a corporate website.
ID Token:

It's a JSON Web Token (JWT) containing information about the user.
Used for identifying users in your application.
Sent securely in HTTP requests between parts of the same application.
It's signed (for authenticity) but not encrypted.


Validating ID Tokens:
When your application receives an ID token, it must:

Verify the signature to ensure it's authentic.
Check certain claims in the token to ensure it's valid.


Important Claims:

Oid (Object ID):

This is the key claim for identifying users or service principals.
It's a unique, unchanging identifier for the user or service making the request.
Same user will have the same oid across different applications in the same Azure AD tenant.
Useful for authorization and as a database key.


Aud (Audience):

Identifies who the token is intended for (usually your application's ID).
Your app should check this to ensure the token was meant for it.


Idp (Identity Provider):

Tells you who authenticated the user (e.g., Azure AD, live.com for personal Microsoft accounts).
