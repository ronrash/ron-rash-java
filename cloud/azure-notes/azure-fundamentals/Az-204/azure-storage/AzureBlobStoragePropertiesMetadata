they have properties called Lease
Lease status --locked

Lease duration -- infinite

A lease is a temporary lock on a blob (or container) that prevents other clients from modifying
or deleting it until the lease expires or is released.
Acquire Lease: A client requests and obtains a lease on a blob, ensuring exclusive access.
Renew Lease: If a client wants to extend the duration of the lease, it can renew it before it expires (only applicable for fixed duration leases).
Release Lease: The client voluntarily releases the lease, allowing other clients to access the blob.
Break Lease: The lease can be forcibly broken, which makes the blob available for access before the lease expires or is released.
