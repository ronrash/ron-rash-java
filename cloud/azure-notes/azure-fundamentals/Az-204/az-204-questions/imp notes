Azure Files is like a shared folder that you can access from anywhere in your Azure environment.
It’s stored in Azure Storage and works with a standard protocol (SMB) that many systems use for file sharing.
 By “mounting” this file share to your container, you’re connecting it to the container so that the data is saved even if the container restarts.
 It’s like attaching an external hard drive to keep your files safe, even if your main computer shuts down.

Key Concepts Explained
Container Images:
A container image is like a template or blueprint.
It includes everything your application needs to run:
the code, libraries, and settings. When you run a container, you’re launching a copy of this image.

Containers:
A container is a running instance of a container image.
It’s like turning on a machine based on a blueprint (the image).
Containers are lightweight and run isolated from one another.

Container Groups:
In Azure Container Instances, a container group is a collection of containers
that run together, share the same resources (like CPU and memory), and network.
Think of it as multiple small machines working closely together in the same environment.

Pods:
In Kubernetes (which Azure Kubernetes Service uses), a pod is similar to a container group.
It’s the smallest unit that runs containers. A pod can contain one or more containers that share resources and are tightly coupled.

Azure File Share:
Azure File Share is a managed file storage solution that acts like a shared network folder in the cloud.
 Multiple containers (or virtual machines) can connect to it and read/write data.

Mounting:
Mounting is the process of connecting an external storage location (like an Azure File Share) to your container so it can use that storage.
 It’s like plugging in a USB drive to give your computer more space.

Summary
Azure Container Instances (ACIs) are temporary by nature, and their data is lost if they restart.
To keep data safe, you can use Azure Files, which is like cloud storage, and “mount” it to your containers.
A container group in ACI is a collection of containers that run together and share resources.
A pod in Kubernetes is similar to a container group.
Mounting means attaching external storage, like an Azure File Share, to your containers.



what is a cache misss?
cache miss is a measure whn ur app fails to get data from the cache.
this can happen due t0 short ttl or  incorrect cache configuration

due to memory pressure then there may be some cache misses but
 a better metric to monitor for memory pressure would be Used Memory or Evicted Keys.

 When using the cache-aside programming pattern, an application looks first in the cache for an item.
  If the item is not there (cache miss), the item is retrieved from the database and added to the cache for next time.
  Cache misses are normal behavior for the cache-aside programming pattern.
  Higher than expected cache misses may be caused by application logic that populates and reads from the cache.

What is app configuration ??
stores application configruation in centalized location along with feature flags
types of application that benefit from app configuration are
Microservices based on Azure Kubernetes Service, Azure Service Fabric, or other containerized apps deployed in one or more geographies
Serverless apps, which include Azure Functions or other event-driven stateless compute apps
Continuous deployment pipeline

App Configuration complements Azure Key Vault, which is used to store application secrets.

Azure Key Vault is designed to securely store and manage sensitive information like secrets, encryption keys, and certificates.
Using Microsoft Entra ID for authentication ensures only authorized applications can access the secrets.
Setting up access policies further refines the control, allowing only specific operations for designated identities. T
his choice aligns with the primary concern of securely managing sensitive configuration data.

The Web Apps service in Azure App Service allows you to create deployment (staging) slots to have a
separate staging environment for testing updates before they get rolled out to production.
 The deployment slot creates a new environment which can then be swapped with the production environment after all testing is complete.
