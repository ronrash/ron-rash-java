  • D. Create a new SpanContext with the TraceFlags value set to the customer ID for the signed in
  user

4.You develop a gateway solution for a public facing news API. The news API back end is implemented as a
  RESTful service and uses an OpenAPI specification.

  Answer: D

5.You develop and add several functions to an Azure Function app that uses the latest runtime host. The
  functions contain several REST API endpoints secured by using SSL. The Azure Function app runs in a
  Consumption plan.
  You must send an alert when any of the function endpoints are unavailable or responding too slowly.
  You need to monitor the availability and responsiveness of the functions.
  What should you do?
  • A. Create a URL ping test.
  • B. Create a timer triggered function that calls TrackAvailability() and send the results to
  Application Insights.
  • C. Create a timer triggered function that calls GetMetric("Request Size") and send the results to
  Application Insights.
  • D. Add a new diagnostic setting to the Azure Function app. Enable the FunctionAppLogs and
  Send to Log Analytics options.
  Answer: B

discard a telemerty - telemerty processor

9.Question #39Topic 5
  You develop and deploy a web app to Azure App Service. The Azure App Service uses a Basic plan in a
  single region.
  Users report that the web app is responding slow. You must capture the complete call stack to help
  identify performance issues in the code. Call stack data must be correlated across app instances. You
  must minimize cost and impact to users on the web app.
  You need to capture the telemetry.
  Which three actions should you perform? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.
  NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.
  • A. Restart all apps in the App Service plan.
  • B. Enable Application Insights site extensions.
