are within a specified distance to an airport.

2.You are developing several Azure API Management (APIM) hosted APIs.
  You must transform the APIs to hide private backend information and obscure the technology stack used
  to implement the backend processing.
  You need to protect all APIs.
  What should you do?
  • A. Configure and apply a new inbound policy scoped to a product.
  • B. Configure and apply a new outbound policy scoped to the operation.
  • C. Configure and apply a new outbound policy scoped to global.
  • D. Configure and apply a new backend policy scoped to global.

3.You plan to use APIM1 to publish an API named API1 that uses a backend database that supports only a
  limited volume of requests per minute. You also need a policy for API1 that will minimize the possibility
  that the number of requests to the backend database from an individual IP address you specify exceeds
  the supported limit.
  You need to identify a policy for API1 that will meet the requirements.
  Which policy should you use?
  • A. ip-filter
  • B. quota-by-key
  • C. rate-limit-by-key --> C
  • D. rate-limit

4.You are developing several Azure API Management (APIM) hosted APIs.
  The APIs have the following requirements:
  • Require a subscription key to access all APIs.
  • Include terms of use that subscribers must accept to use the APIs.
  • Administrators must review and accept or reject subscription attempts.
  • Limit the count of multiple simultaneous subscriptions.
  You need to implement the APIs.
  What should you do?
  • A. Configure and apply header-based versioning.
  • B. Create and publish a product.
  • C. Configure and apply query string-based versioning.
  • D. Add a new revision to all APIs. Make the revisions current and add a change log entry.
  Correct Answer: B

5.You are developing several Azure API Management (APIM) hosted APIs.
  You must inspect request processing of the APIs in APIM. Requests to APIM by using a REST client must
  also be included. The request inspection must include the following information:
  • requests APIM sent to the API backend and the response it received
  • policies applied to the response before sending back to the caller
  • errors that occurred during the processing of the request and the policies applied to the errors
  • original request APIM received from the caller and the policies applied to the request
  You need to inspect the APIs.
  Which three actions should you do? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.
  NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.
  • A. Enable the Allow tracing setting for the subscription used to inspect the API.
  • B. Add the Ocp-Apim-Trace header value to the API call whit a value set to true.
  • C. Add the Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key header value to the key for a subscription that allows
  access to the API.

  • D. Create and configure a custom policy. Apply the policy to the inbound policy section with a
  global scope.
  • E. Create and configure a custom policy. Apply the policy to the outbound policy section with an
  API scope.
  Correct Answer: ABC

6.You are developing several Azure API Management (APIM) hosted APIs.
  You must make several minor and non-breaking changes to one of the APIs. The API changes include the
  following requirements:
  • Must not disrupt callers of the API.
  • Enable roll back if you find issues.
  • Documented to enable developers to understand what is new.
  • Tested before publishing.
  You need to update the API.
  What should you do?
  • A. Configure and apply header-based versioning.
  • B. Create and publish a product.
  • C. Configure and apply a custom policy.
  • D. Add a new revision to the API. --> ans
  • E. Configure and apply query string-based versioning.

7.You are developing a web application that runs as an Azure Web App. The web application stores data in
Azure SQL Database and stores files in an Azure
Storage account. The web application makes HTTP requests to external services as part of normal
operations.
The web application is instrumented with Application Insights. The external services are OpenTelemetry
compliant.
You need to ensure that the customer ID of the signed in user is associated with all operations
throughout the overall system.
What should you do?
• A. Add the customer ID for the signed in user to the CorrelationContext in the web application
• B. On the current SpanContext, set the TraceId to the customer ID for the signed in user
• C. Set the header Ocp-Apim-Trace to the customer ID for the signed in user
• D. Create a new SpanContext with the TraceFlags value set to the customer ID for the signed in
user
Answer: A

8.he question is included in a number of questions that depicts the identical set-up. However, every
  question has a distinctive result. Establish if the solution satisfies the requirements.
  You are developing a solution for a public facing API.
  The API back end is hosted in an Azure App Service instance. You have implemented a RESTful service for
  the API back end.
  You must configure back-end authentication for the API Management service instance.
  Solution: You configure Client cert gateway credentials for the Azure resource.
  Does the solution meet the goal?
  • A. Yes
  • B. No
  no use jwt or manged identity for backedn service
