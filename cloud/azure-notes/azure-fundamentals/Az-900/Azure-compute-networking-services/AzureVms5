Reliability and performance
Security
Ease of Use
Customizable virtual networks
Alias records


Azure DNS uses anycast networking, so each DNS query is answered by the closest available DNS server

Azure DNS is based on Azure Resource Manager and has features like
Azure Rbac - control who has access to specific actions for your organization
Activity logs to monitor how a user in your organization modified a resource or to find an error when troubleshooting.
Resource locking to lock a subscription, resource group, or resource.
Locking prevents other users in your organization from accidentally deleting or modifying critical resources.

Azure DNS can manage DNS records for your Azure services and provide DNS for your external resources as well
Azure DNS also supports private DNS domains.
use your own custom domain names in your private virtual networks
Azure DNS also supports alias record sets.
u can use an alias record set to refer to an Azure resource like Azure public IP address,
an Azure Traffic Manager profile, or an Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) endpoint.
 If the IP address of the underlying resource changes, the alias record set seamlessly updates itself during DNS resolution

 You can't use Azure DNS to buy a domain name
 For an annual fee, you can buy a domain name by using App Service domains or a third-party domain name registrar
