Describe the benefits of reliability and predictability in the cloud
Reliability and predictability are two crucial cloud benefits that help you develop solutions with confidence.


Reliability is the ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function.
It's also one of the pillars of the Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework.
The cloud, by virtue of its decentralized design, naturally supports a reliable and resilient infrastructure
if obe region is down reources might be running in other regions


Predictability in the cloud lets you move forward with confidence.
Predictability can be focused on performance predictability or cost predictability.

Perfromance - Autoscaling, load balancing, and high availability
Cost - Cost predictability is focused on predicting or forecasting the cost of the cloud spend

You can use -  Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) or Pricing Calculator to get an estimate of potential cloud spend.


benefits of security and governance in the cloud
set templates ensure corporate standards are met,security,Cloud-based auditing


benefits of manageability in the cloud
major benefit of cloud computing is the manageability option

2 types of management
Management of the cloud
Automatically scale resource deployment based on need.
 Deploy resources based on a preconfigured template, removing the need for manual configuration.
 Monitor the health of resources and automatically replace failing resources.
 Receive automatic alerts based on configured metrics, so youâ€™re aware of performance in real time.

 management in cloud
 Through a web portal.
 Using a command line interface.
 Using APIs.
 Using PowerShell.
