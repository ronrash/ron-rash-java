HDFS - hadoop distributed file system -> storing large amounts of data across multiple servers/machines
       breaks data into blocks for high availabilty and reliabilty.


MapReduce --> Parallel processing of these data -- to get the final result


Hadoop issues -- hadoop relies on disk based storage,ie. high disk i/o operation slow process.
                 Apache spark is in memory processing framework.
                 coding in hadoop is difficult


Apache Spark -- In memory processing, easy to use , sdk with java scala SQl, 100x faster than  MapReduce
                Apis in multiple langauage
