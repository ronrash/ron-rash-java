Real-Time Example: E-Commerce Sales Data Pipeline
Scenario: You work for an e-commerce company and need to create a pipeline to:

Extract sales data from a cloud storage (e.g., Azure Blob Storage).
Transform the data by cleaning and aggregating it.
Load the transformed data into an Azure SQL Database for analytics.


Pipeline Creation Steps
1.Create a Linked Service: Connect ADF to Azure Blob Storage and Azure SQL Database.
2.Create a Dataset: Define input and output data formats (e.g., CSV for Blob, SQL table for Azure SQL).
3.Design the Pipeline: Drag and drop a Copy Activity for extracting and loading data.
4.Trigger the Pipeline:Schedule the pipeline to run daily.

example of the pipeline

1.Source -- Azure blob storage --> sales_data.csv
Columns: product_id, sales_date, quantity, price

2. transform the data  --> Add a column total_sales = quantity * price also Filter rows where quantity is null.

3. Destination: Azure SQL Database --> Table: sales_analytics
Columns: product_id, sales_date, total_sales
