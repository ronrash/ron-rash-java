Querying files in Databricks

CTAS stands for Create Table As Select. It is used to create a new table based on the result of a query


Using Ctas Statements CREATE TABLE AS SELECT QUERY
CREATE TABLE table_name
AS SELECT * FROM FILE_FORMAT.`/path/file_name.json`

Spark Sql statements to extract data from external files

Example to read file from a json
select * from json.`/path/file_name.json`

to extract data from text based files use
select * from text.`/path/file_name.json`

to extract fileas as raw data use
select * from binaryFile.`/path/file_name.json`.

CTAS STATEMENTS CREATE TABLE AS SELECT QUERY
CREATE TABLE table_name
AS SELECT * FROM FILE_FORMAT.`/path/file_name.json`

CTAS statements  do not support specifying additional file options LIKE CSV ,,
WE CAN EXTRATCT DATA FROM PQRQUET OR JSON FORMATS BUT
 when it comes to csv
This solution is the regular Create Table statement, but with the USING keyword.


create table(id int, name string)
using data_Source
options(key1=val1, key2=val2)
location =path

example of creating a table using csv in an external location
create table(id int, name string)
using csv
options(header=true,delimiter=";")
location =path

using a database
create table(col1,col2)
using jdbc
options(url='',
        dbtable="database.table"
        user="username",
        password="pwd")

A table with external data source is not a delta table and has its limitations ie it will not have all the feature like time
tavel of delta table

Solution is
create a temp view referring to external datasource and then query the temp view to create a table using CTAS statements

create temp view temp_view_name(col1,col2)
using data_source
options()

create table table_name
As select * from temp_view_name
