 Stream Using spark.readStream.table Vs Auto Loader
Both approaches use spark.readStream to process streaming data,
 but there are key differences in their use cases, configuration, and functionality.

Reads streaming data directly from an existing Delta table.
Assumes the Delta table is already configured as a streaming source (i.e., it receives new data incrementally).

(spark.readStream
     .table("books")  # Input: Delta table
     .createOrReplaceTempView("books_streaming_view")  # Temporary view
)

spark.readStream works with only with Delta tables that are already configured for streaming
automatically picks up new data and  uses schema definde in the delta table

Use Case:

When you already have a Delta table as the source for streaming.
Example: If books is a Delta table continuously updated by another process.


Using Auto Loader with spark.readStream.format("cloudFiles")
Reads streaming data incrementally from cloud storage directories (e.g., S3, ADLS, or DBFS).
Uses Auto Loader, a high-performance ingestion mechanism, to detect new files and load them.

(spark.readStream
      .format("cloudFiles")  # Auto Loader for file-based ingestion
      .option("cloudFiles.format", "parquet")  # Input file format
      .option("cloudFiles.schemaLocation", "dbfs:/mnt/demo/orders_checkpoint")  # Schema tracking
      .load("/path/to/data/source")  # Source directory
      .writeStream
      .option("checkpointLocation", "dbfs:/mnt/demo/orders_checkpoint")  # Checkpointing
      .table("order_updates")  # Target Delta table
)

Feature	            spark.readStream.table	                Auto Loader (cloudFiles)
Source	            Delta table	                            Directory of files
Schema Management	Inherited from the Delta table	        Automatic with schema inference and tracking
Data Detection	    New rows in the Delta table	            New files in the directory
File Formats	    Not applicable	                        Supports multiple formats (parquet, csv, etc.)
Scalability	        Limited to Delta table updates	        Handles millions or billions of files
Use Case	        When data is already in a Delta table	When ingesting raw data from file-based sources
