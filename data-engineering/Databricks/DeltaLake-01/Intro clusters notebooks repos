We create a cluster ,, a single cluster
A cluster in Databricks provides the compute power to run large-scale data processing tasks.
Clusters are scalable; you can adjust the number of nodes based on your workload.
 This is particularly useful for optimizing costs and performance


Azure Databricks is commonly used for cleaning, transforming, and preparing data for downstream analytics.
Clusters allow you to use notebooks in Databricks for interactive development and exploration.
Multiple users can share a single cluster for collaborative development and testing, leveraging the workspace features.

what are notebooks?
Notebooks are coding environments allowing you to interactively developing and executing code on databricks.
they support many languages scala r python
u can collaborate with different teams share

Magic commands
%sql
%md -- markdown

run magic command that allows us to run another notebook from the current notebook.
%run
simply create another notebook sya we have 2 notebooks n1 and n2 -- we are currently in n1

n2 has pyhtom code like
name ="rohit"

in notebook n1
use
%run ./pathofthenotebook1
print(name)

%fs maggic command for lsiting files and folders
%fs ls '/databricks-datasets'

use dbutils function to see filesystem
dbutils.fs.help();
