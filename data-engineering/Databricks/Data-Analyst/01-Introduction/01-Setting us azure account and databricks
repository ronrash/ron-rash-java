1. Create a Azure databricks service
 Resource group ==rondatabrick21
 Location  ------>UK South
 Subscription ---->rohitp21subscription

Defintion what is a unity catalog ??
 centralized governance solution across all your workspaces

2. Enable Unity catalog

 Azure data lake  u will give {storage blob data
 Storage Gen2       contributor access}                                        {access connector id }
      +               <-----------------==access connector for azure dbricks <--------------------==unity catakog in dbirkc workspace
  Container


3. create a azure storage account
What is azure data lake --> data lake is a single centralized repo where u can store huge amounts of data structure or unstructured
Azure data lake storage is the cloud version of that called Azure Data Lake StorageGen2
Data Lake Storage Gen2 supports a hierarchical directory structure. easy to organize and manage data
it leverages azure blob storage
scalable hadoop like features

Subscription   ==    rohitp21subscription
Resource group  ==   rondatabrick21
Location    ==   UK South
Storage account name    == dbricksstorage27december

Performance     ==   Premium
Premium account type    -==  Block blobs
Replication     ==   Locally-redundant storage (LRS)

Advanced
Enable hierarchical namespace ==>Enabled

Under ur resource group ===>rondatabrick21
u will have 2 resources


Name                        Type                                location
databricksworkspace         Azure Databricks Service            UK South
dbricksstorage27december    Storage account                     UK South

lets create a container under the storage account --> ucmetastore to store metadata


4. Access connector
The Access Connector for Databricks is a feature that allows Databricks to securely access data stored
in Azure Data Lake Storage GEn2 and Blob storage
So what we'll do is create the access connector for Databricks and then give that storage blob data
contributor access to the container in our Data Lake Storage Gen2.

Create an Access Connector for Azure Databricks

Subscription      rohitp21subscription
Resource group    rondatabrick21
Name              access27dec
Region            UK South

And the role assignment you want to add is a storage blob data contributor --> to a managed Indentity --> ur recnlty created access connector
