In this demo, we will explore how to manage permissions for databases, tables and views in Databricks SQL.
Navigate to the Databricks SQL Workspace.
Make sure that your SQL warehouse is running.
And now navigate to the SQL editor in the left sidebar.


this demo, we will create a database called HR DB.
And within this database, we will create a table called employees with ID, name, salary and city columns.
Then we will insert some data in this table.
And lastly, we will create a view for employees in Paris city.
Let us run these commands.

CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS hr_db
LOCATION 'dbfs:/mnt/demo/hr_db.db'

use hr_db
CREATE TABLE EMPLOYEES(id INT,name String, salary DOUBLE,city STRING);

insert into EMPLOYEES values(1,'ron',2000,'londo',.....)

select * from employees
0/p

Let us start by granting several privileges on the whole HR database to a group of users called HR Team

GRANT SELECT,MODIFY, READ_METADATA, CREATE ON SCHEMA  hr_db To hr_team

So all the members in this group will have the ability to read, and modify the data,access metadata information,
and also the ability to create a new object like tables and view in this database.

However, for users to perform any action on a database object, they must have an additional privilege,
which is the USAGE privilege.
Without this privilege, the objects in the database cannot be used.

Grant usage on schema hr_db To hr_team;

Grant SELECT access to a user for a specific table:
grant select on table my_table to 'user123@gmail.com'

Here, for example, we are granting a read access on our view object to a user from outside of the HR team.
grant select ON VIEW hr_db.some_view_name to 'outsideuser@gmail.com'

to show all the grants
show grants on schema hr_db
