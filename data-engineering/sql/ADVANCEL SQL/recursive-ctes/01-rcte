recuresive cte

recursive cte is used to deal wth hierarchy

now suppose we have a table -->
employee_id	    name	manager_id
1	            Alice	    NULL
2	            Bob	        1
3	            Charlie	    1
4	            David	    2
5	            Eve	        2
6	            Frank	    3

Alice is at the top (no manager).
Bob and Charlie report to Alice.
David and Eve report to Bob.
Frank reports to Charlie

query

with recursive org_chart as  -- Anchor Member: Select top-level manager(s)
(
 select employee_id,name,manager_id,
 0 as level,                       --> We assign 0 AS level because these employees are at the top (level 0).
 cast(name as varchar(1000)) as chain_of_command
 from employees where manager_id is null
)
cast --> starts the chain with the employee's own name. We cast it to a string type long enough to hold the entire chain later.

union all --keyword combines the results of the anchor member with the results of the recursive member.
The anchor provides the starting point.
The recursive part will then add more rows (each subordinate) based on those starting rows.
