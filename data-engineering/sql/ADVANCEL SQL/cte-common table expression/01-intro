common table expression -- break down complex queries , provodes a temporary result
Imagine you have a table of sales data and you want to calculate total sales per customer first, then filter those results:

sale_id	    customer_id	    sale_amount
1	        101	            400
2	        101	            700
3	        102	            500
4	        103	            200
5	        102	            600
6	        103	            900
7	        104	            1500
8	        105	            800

calculates total sales per customer, followed by a filter to return only those customers whose total sales exceed 1000

with customer_Sales as (
select customer_id,
       sum(sale_amount) as total_sales
       from table_name
)
select customer_id,total_sales
from customer_Sales
where total_sales >1000

explanation - the query first creates a cte --common table expression named customer_Sales

0/p
customer_id	total_sales
101	            1100
102	            1100
103	            1100
104	            1500
