Spark is a data processing platform
2 ways 2 process data using
1. Spark database and sql
2. spark dataframe and api

Saprk data frame are in memory - is a runtime and temporary object
spark tables are permanent

Spark table                               vs           Sprak data frames
table store schema info in metadatastore             dataframes store schema in runtime catalogs
table and schema are persistent objects               dataframes and catalog are runtime objects
and visible throught an application                   live only thru the app runtime-- only visble durinhg application
tbales have sql                                       data frames are supproted thru apis

====================================

every spark table or dataframe has 3 layers
look at the image

first layer is the metadata layer --> table or dataframe schema info-- tells u where the data is or what is the schema of the data of the table
second layer is the - physical storage layer whihc is the top layer on any cloud storage -- abstraction or mounting on cloud storages like
aws s3 or azure blobl storages - spark data lives in data files
third layer{middle layer } is the compute layer --> runs ur spark sql engine
