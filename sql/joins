inner join -- records which occur in both the tables with something in common

select * from employee_table
inner join depament_table
on emp.name = dept.name;  // some common column name


full outer join grabs entire data from both tables
full outer join with where will get unique rows from either table
which is basically opposite of inner join . rows unique to eeach table


left outer join returns content exclusivley from the left table
which mean it will return everything from left table and also what both tbales have in common but not
anything specific to right table

this query will return everything from table1 and also common names between the 2 tables if any
select * from table1
left outer join table2
on table1.name = table2.name

now oif we perform a where is nul it will give us contents exclusive to left table

this query will return which is only specific to table1 becoz of the null condition
select * from table1
left outer join table2
on table1.name = table2.name where table2.name is null
