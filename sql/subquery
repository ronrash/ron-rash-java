subquery is basically a 2 step process
the inner query is executed first and then the outer query
we can also use in operator if we have multiple results return from the subquery


A suquery can perofrom on another table as well

select marks from marks_table
where student_name in (select student_name from student_table)

the exist operator is used to test for existence of rows in the subquery
A subquery is passedin the EXISTS() function to check if the subquery returned any results

eg /*
    return back the films that have a rental rate higher than the average rental rate

     2 step process
     1. calcualte average rental rate -   select avg(rental_rate) from film; this return 70
     2. from that result return films > rental rate
   */
   select rental_rate from film where rental_rate > (select avg(rental_rate) from film);

/*
 i want to see which films are returned between 2 specific dates
 returned dates are in rental table which has inventory id
 now inventory id is in inventory table along with film id
 film id is in film table with title

so maping is done in this way we first get invenory id from rental thru that we also get the film id
and then do join on film table
*/

/*
this query will give us the film ids in inventory table becoz of the join between rental and
inventory table
then we do a jon on inventory and film table to get film
titles becoz they have primary and foreign key relationship
*/
select film_id, title
from film where film_id in
(select inventory.film_id
from rental inner join inventory on  inventory.inventory_id = rental.inventory_id
where return_date between '2005-05-29' and '2005-05-30')
order by title ;


/*
same can be done using exists function 
it checs if we get any result from subquery
*/

select first_name,last_name from customer as c 
where exists 
(
select * from payment as p where p.customer_id = c.customer_id and amount >11 
);
