Aspect	                    NLP	                                                        LLM
Scope	                Broad field of AI.	                                      A specific type of model within NLP.
Examples	            Translation, chatbots, text mining.	                    ChatGPT, GPT-4, BERT, etc.
Techniques  Used	Includes simpler approaches
                    (e.g., rule-based models, statistical models).	            Deep learning models based on transformers.
Complexity	        Can use both simple and advanced tools.	                    Focuses on advanced tools like transformers.
Training Data	    May work with small or specialized datasets.	            Trained on massive datasets (e.g., books, websites).
Capabilities	    Task-specific, may require fine-tuning for each task.	    General-purpose, can handle multiple tasks without specific tuning.


Analogy for Better Understanding
NLP: Like a toolbox. It has various tools like screwdrivers, hammers, and wrenches to solve different problems.
LLM: A power drill inside the toolbox. It’s a powerful, versatile tool for many tasks, but it’s not the only tool in the box.


Prompt Design (Basic):
Task: Write a poem about cats.
Prompt: "Write a 4-line poem about a cat."

Prompt Engineering (Advanced):
Task: Write a poem about cats in a Shakespearean style.
Prompt: "Write a 4-line poem about a cat in the style of Shakespeare, using iambic pentameter and old English phrasing."

Prompt Design is about what you ask.
Prompt Engineering is about how you ask to get the most precise and optimized result.

3 kinds of llm
Generic language models
Instruction tuned
Dialog tuned

Generic lms -- Large models trained on diverse datasets to predict the next word or token in a sequence.
Focus on understanding and generating general text.
- Not optimized for specific tasks.
eg -- GPT-3, BERT, LLaMA
Example Prompt:
Input: "Write a story about space exploration."
Output: May generate a narrative but could lack coherence or relevance without detailed prompting

Instruction tuned -- models which are fine tuned to follow specific instructions ,
like InstructGPT
Example Prompt:
Input: "Summarize this article in 3 points."
Output: Provides concise, relevant summaries in point form

Dailog tuned -- like chat gpt, claude ai-- for more converstaion with humans
Best for chatbots, personal assistants, and multi-turn interaction

Chain of thought reasoning --> models are getting better after the first anw

Task specific tuning makes lllm more efficiient and reliable
like customers are buying what on what day -- sentimnetal model
train or fine tune a model on specific tasks like medical field
