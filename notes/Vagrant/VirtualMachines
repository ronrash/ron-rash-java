A hypervisor, also known as a virtual machine monitor (VMM), is a software or hardware component
that allows multiple operating systems (OS) to run on a single physical computer or server simultaneously.
It essentially abstracts and virtualizes the underlying hardware,
enabling the creation and management of multiple virtual machines (VMs) on a single physical host.

There are two main types of hypervisors:
Type 1 Hypervisor (Bare-Metal Hypervisor):
 This type of hypervisor runs directly on the physical hardware without the need for an underlying operating system.
 It provides a high level of performance and is often used in enterprise environments.
 Examples of Type 1 hypervisors include VMware vSphere/ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, and Xen.

Type 2 Hypervisor (Hosted Hypervisor): Type 2 hypervisors run on top of a host operating system.
They are typically used for development, testing, and desktop virtualization scenarios.
Examples include Oracle VirtualBox and VMware Workstation.

Hypervisors are essential in server virtualization,
 where they allow multiple virtual machines to share the same physical server,
  each running its own operating system and applications.
  This technology provides benefits such as server consolidation, resource optimization, improved flexibility, and enhanced security through isolation between virtual machines.

Hypervisors have become a fundamental component of cloud computing and data center management,
enabling the efficient allocation of computing resources and the rapid deployment of virtual machines to meet varying workloads and demands.
