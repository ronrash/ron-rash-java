Vagrant is an automation tool which uses HypervisorType2{for managing these  virtual machines }

Why Vagrant -->
No need for Os
Automatic installation
Mangae all the vm settings in a file VagrnatFile
Provisioning

Comands are simple for a Vagrant
Vagrant up
vm vagrant ssh --> go inside the vm
vagrant halt
vagrant destroy

Steps to create Vagrant
mkdir ~/Desktop/vagrant-vms -> create a dir in the home folder
mkdir centos
mkdir ubuntu

Inside centos folder -- go to vagrant cloud and copy the image for centos
vagrant init generic/centos7 --> this will download a vagrant file along with
ls
vagrantFile --> this file has all the information
vagrant up --> brings up the virtual machine
vagrant status --> shows status of that vagrant in that folder
vagrant global-status --> status of all the vms
vagrant globla-status --prune --> remove all the vms
vagrant destroy --force --> destroys all the vms created in that folder
vagrant ssh -> inside the vm
sudo -i --> change as roor user
whoami
exit

then there is oemthing called synced directoreis -> basically whaever u create/edit/delet inside these they will replicate
config.vm.synced_folder "/Users/rohitprashar/Desktop/vagrant-vms/ubuntu", "/opt/scripts"

Provisioning - Provisioning in vagrant means executing commands or scripts when the VM comes up.


Now we have a virtual machine monitor in oracle virtual box which is basically a hypervisor2 (hosted hypervisor) which needs the underlying os)
We use vagrant {an automated tool to manage vm inside our virtual box}

inside ubuntu folder
we will --> install ubuntu image -- this will download the vagrant image -- where we have can change public/private settings for
sync directories

steps-->
vagrant init generic/centos7 --> this is the box name 0r os a vagrant file will be placed inside our folder


# to make changes to the vagrant file lets open up that
vim VagrantFile --> setup a ip address,ram,static ip address

vagrant up --> will basically bring up our virtual environment or servers
vagrant ssh -> go inside the vm

sudo -i --> switch  to root user
vim etc/hostname --> change the hostname
exit

then go to the documentation to perform the steps to install wordpress on our machine
vagrant ssh
sudo -i

# install dependeince basically follo all he steps from the documentation
sudo apt update  ->> a
