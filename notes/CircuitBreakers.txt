CircuitBreaker Patttern
Hystrix circuit Breaker Framework will tolerate failures up to a threshold. Beyond that, it leaves the circuit open.
Which means, it will forward all subsequent calls to the fallback method,
to prevent future failures. This creates a time buffer for the related service to recover from its failing state.

Wraps up our rest api call in a circuit breaker object which monitors for failure
Once the failure reaches a certain threshold .the circuit breaks or opens and we can configure a fallback method
to show some default response
Its is proxy call
