What is a dlq
A DLQ (Dead Letter Queue) is a specialized queue in a messaging system that stores messages
 that cannot be processed by the intended recipient, typically due to errors or exceptions.
 When a message cannot be processed, it is moved to a DLQ for further analysis, debugging, and potential reprocessing.


 How can a DLQ occur in an event-driven system?

 In an event-driven system, a DLQ can occur when an event is published to a topic or queue,
 but the intended listener or consumer is unable to process the event. This can happen due to various reasons, such as:

 Deserialization errors: The event payload cannot be deserialized correctly by the listener, causing the event to be rejected.
 Business logic errors: The listener encounters an error while processing the event, such as a null pointer exception or a database connection issue.
 Network or infrastructure issues: The listener is unavailable or unreachable due to network connectivity problems or server crashes.
 Message format or schema errors: The event payload does not conform to the expected format or schema, causing the listener to reject the event.
