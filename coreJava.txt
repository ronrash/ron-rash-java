JIt compiler -- source code is converted to byte code by the javac.exe -- compile the ccode
,, then the byte code is now machine independent -- to convert it to the machine code the  jre (intrepreter+jit compiler)
converts it to the machine code
JIt compiler makes it fast to to compile the code to machine code since the intrepreter is quite slow.

Why String is immutable in java?
1) String pool requires string to be immutable otherwise shared reference can be changed from anywhere.
2) security because string is shared on different area like file system, networking connection, database connection ,
having immutable string allows you to be secure and safe because no one can change reference of string once it gets created.


Marker Interface
Serializable Cloneable -- these are empty interface tells ur compiler --meta data or information given to the interfaces

finalyy methode does not execute  -- System.exit() or system.crash

Q) What Methods Does the Object Class Have?
clone,equlas,finalize ,getClass hashcode tostring notify
protected Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException
  Creates and returns a copy of this object.

public boolean equals(Object obj)
  Indicates whether some other object is “equal to” this one.

protected Integer finalize() throws Throwable
  Called by the garbage collector on an object when garbagecollection   determines that there are no more references to the object.

public final Class getClass() : Returns the runtime class of an object.

public int hashCode(): Returns a hash code value for the object.

public String toString(): Returns a string representation of the object.

public final Integer notify()
public final Integer notifyAll()
public final Integer wait()
public final Integer wait(long timeout)
public final Integer wait(long timeout, int nanos)
