Market Cap ($928,460,711)
What is it?
Market Cap is the total value of all circulating coins. It’s calculated as:
Market Cap= Current Price× Circulating Supply
Market Cap=Current Price×Circulating Supply
It gives an idea of how big or valuable the project is in the market.
Why is it important?
Small-Cap (<$1 billion): High potential for growth, but riskier and more volatile.
Mid-Cap ($1–$10 billion): Moderate growth potential with less risk compared to small-cap.
Large-Cap (>$10 billion): Generally safer, but slower

Circulating Supply ==> number of tokens currently in circulation and actively traded.
Total Supply  - total number of tokens ever created by the project
