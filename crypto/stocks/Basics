What is F&O (Futures and Options)?
F&O are contracts that allow you to bet on the price of stocks, indices (e.g., Nifty, S&P500), or commodities (e.g., Gold, Oil) without owning them. They are riskier but give you more control.
Futures:
A future is a contract to buy or sell something (like a stock) at a fixed price on a future date. You can profit from price movements without owning the stock.

Example of Futures:
Let’s say you believe Nifty (a stock index) will rise in the next week.
You buy a Nifty Future at 19,000.
If Nifty rises to 19,200, your profit is:
200 points × lot size (e.g., 50).
200 × 50 = ₹10,000 profit.
