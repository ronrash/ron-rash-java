1.Create SSH Keys for AKS Linux VMs
Declare Windows Username, Passwords for Windows nodepools.
This needs to be done during the creation of cluster for
 1st time itself if you have plans for Windows workloads on your cluster
Understand about Datasources and Create Datasource for Azure AKS latest Version
Create Azure Log Analytics Workspace Resource in Terraform
Create Azure AD AKS Admins Group Resource in Terraform
Create AKS Cluster with default nodepool
Create AKS Cluster Output Values
Provision Azure AKS Cluster using Terraform
Access and Test using Azure AKS default admin --admin
Access and Test using Azure AD User as AKS Admin


#Create SSH Keys for AKS Linux VMs why this is needed ??
when we create linux node pools in our cloud servers we have to access those for that we
need create a ssh keys to login which is a secure service to login

commands to create the ssh keys
# Create Folder
mkdir $HOME/.ssh/aks-prod-sshkeys-terraform

# Create SSH Key
ssh-keygen \
    -m PEM \
    -t rsa \
    -b 4096 \
    -C "azureuser@myserver" \
    -f ~/.ssh/aks-prod-sshkeys-terraform/aksprodsshkey \
    -N mypassphrase

# List Files
ls -lrt $HOME/.ssh/aks-prod-sshkeys-terraform

This basically generates a private key and a public key .. the public key is kept in the server and the private in our own machine

2. create azure windows/ linux variables and add them to the variabes.tf files
# V2 Changes
# SSH Public Key for Linux VMs
variable "ssh_public_key" {
  default = "~/.ssh/aks-prod-sshkeys-terraform/aksprodsshkey.pub"
  description = "This variable defines the SSH Public Key for Linux k8s Worker nodes"
}

3. Create Datasource for Azure AKS latest Version
What are datasources ?
Data sources allow Terraform to use information defined outside of Terraform,
defined by another separate Terraform configuration, or modified by functions.

Use Azure AKS versions datasource API to get the latest version of aks  and use it
az aks get-versions --location centralus -o table
