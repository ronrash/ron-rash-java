#! --> bsically means shebang
#!/bin --> the path // there
##!/bin/bash,dash,ksh,sh --> these are diff executables to execute this script and they have different syntax
# similar to java it needs an executable to tell the linux kernal to exexute this command


execute this file ./ <name-of the file>
or sh <name-of-the-file>

touch vs vim vs cat
touch -- creates a file also updates a file
vim --> creates and opens a file
cat --> opens the contents of a file
chmod -- grant permission
ch -- change

chmod <file-name>

VVV --> first V ur permission second vv grp permission thrird vvv --all users
user,group,everyone

linux uses formula 7 {4 2 1}
4 - read
2 - write
1 - execute

chmod 444 xyz.sh --> every body has only read permission
chmod 777 xyz.sh -->  everyone has read/write/ex permission

chmod 777

top -- > to check/analyze the health of ur node ,cpu and ram,all running sleeping consuming process
run a script file to check all of these and run the top command inside ur script
df --> prints all info about storage space on this virtual machine
free --> memory of the machine
nproc --> cpu of the current machine

ps -ef --> show all the process running on my machine
ps -ef | grep "" --> | called as pipe is used to intregrate 2 separate commands , it will intgerate output of first command to second command
.test.sh | grep 5 --> suppose the script file out 5,10,15 | grep 5 will further filter the output and return 5 and 15
grep is global regular expression print

| pipe will send the output of the first command to the second command

cur helps us to connect to remote servs using protcocals like http,ldap etc
curl  is  a  tool to transfer data from or to a server, using one of the supported protocols
       (DICT, FILE, FTP, FTPS, GOPHER, HTTP, HTTPS, IMAP, IMAPS, LDAP, LDAPS,  POP3,  POP3S,  RTMP,
       RTSP,  SCP,  SFTP, SMB, SMBS, SMTP, SMTPS, TELNET and TFTP). The command is designed to work
       without user interaction

so suppose my logs are store in azure blobl storage and there is an error, i will use the curl command to fetch the
log file from azure blob or aws s3 and check for errors in the file

curl https://....../logerrorfile.log | grep error
another command i can use is the wget --> downloads the file
wget https://....../logerrorfile.log --> this will download the file ,save it and then we can grep for errors

and then use
cat logerrorfile.log | grep error

to get info use
curl -X GET facebook.com

ps -ef | grep amazon | awk -F" " '{print $2}'
ps -ef --> show all the process
grep amazo --> from all the process show only amazon process
awk -F" " '{print $2}' from the amazon process only show column 2nd
this means show all the process | grep amazon and awk that means show 2nd colun

if we run
ps -ef | grep amazon
501 45284 42295   0 12:15pm ttys001    0:00.00 grep amazon

ps -ef | grep amazon | awk -F" " '{print $2}'
